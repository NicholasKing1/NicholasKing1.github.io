<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
