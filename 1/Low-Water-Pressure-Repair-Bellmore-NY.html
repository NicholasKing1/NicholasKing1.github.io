<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet in Bellmore NY</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
