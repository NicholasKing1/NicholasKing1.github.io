<p>Because the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to end up being covered inside, New homes built with copper pipes are especially susceptible to destructive water conditions. As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new home for a period of 3 to five months after tenancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Many new homes are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
