<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Garrett IN</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does occur more frequently than you believe! When you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, typically it happens at night. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks use huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The watering backflow testing season is from May to September. Watering backflow prevention assemblies must be evaluated by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to make sure proper backflow prevention remains in location to safeguard our drinking water during the watering season. Denver Water will send a testing suggestion notification 1 month before the yearly test is due.</p>
