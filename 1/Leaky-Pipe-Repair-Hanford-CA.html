<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains significant amounts of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a nuisance-- for its many desired usages around your house.</p>
