<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which designs are best for particular applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are spelled out by ecological guidelines and local statutes. Local building codes for instance will require a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air space between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any potential siphon before it can occur, preventing infecting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more sophisticated and complicated backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices installed to avoid backflow range from the relatively easy to the complex and extremely sophisticated.</p>
