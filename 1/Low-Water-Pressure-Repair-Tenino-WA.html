<p>A & frac13; HP or 1/2 HP garbage disposal system can grind soft, non-fibrous foods. There is really little insulation in the weaker designs. Here are some typical types of garbage disposals you may wish to think about. There are usually 2 types of disposals: aluminum and stainless steel. Aluminum disposals are the most cost-effective, costing about $70 to $150 a pop but are susceptible to deterioration and leaking.</p>
<p>The system has actually gone back to a no demand condition (no valves open downstream). However, debris between the # 1 Check Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the parts, is preventing the # 1 Inspect from closing all the way. This enables pressure to match between the Supply Side and the Zone of Lowered Pressure. When this takes place, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
