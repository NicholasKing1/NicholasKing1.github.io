<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical flow instructions within a piping system that is triggered by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of regular circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that manages water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters your toilet.

If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't set up appropriately, you might experience an often or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>
