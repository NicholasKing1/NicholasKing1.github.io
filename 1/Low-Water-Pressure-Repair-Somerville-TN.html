<p>Other pipe repair methods include our Pipe Pull strategy and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull strategy interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a tiny hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into location. All brand-new replacement pipes have a forecasted lifespan of one a century and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another efficient technique is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically eliminates the need for broken pipe removal. By placing a solidifying lining material which coats the within the existing pipe, a new pipe is created inside the broken one.</p>
