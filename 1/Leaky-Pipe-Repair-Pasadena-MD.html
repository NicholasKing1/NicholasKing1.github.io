Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material.

More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
