<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water passes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is generally used in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
<p>During normal operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of reduced pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is created to open and release water to the outside. An RPZ will regularly release percentages of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ must be set up in areas that are exempt to water damage and allow adequate drainage.</p>
