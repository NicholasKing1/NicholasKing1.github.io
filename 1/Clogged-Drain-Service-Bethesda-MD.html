<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Bethesda MD</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system must be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>Discharge piping linked to a storm sewer shall be equipped with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices suggests a DCV assembly on wet or dry lawn sprinkler unless there is a risk of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
