If the leak is far enough down the water line, water will drip into the cabinet beneath. A decreased pressure backflow preventer is the top of the line when it comes to backflow preventers, and is the device of choice because it can hold up against the introduction of fertilizer or other chemicals, it's also a smart choice for residential water supply.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
