<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is among the least pricey backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage only for non-health risk or health danger conditions. They should be set up downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some towns do not allow the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can only secure versus back siphonage.</p>
