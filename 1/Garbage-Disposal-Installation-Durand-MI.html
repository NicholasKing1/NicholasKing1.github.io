After we have cleaned up the body, and the fixed components are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be tricky, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system needs to be made use of to ensure the line is correctly flushed.</p>
