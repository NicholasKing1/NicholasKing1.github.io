<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Paola KS</h3>
<p>Plumbing and piping technology has improved over the last thirty years. Copper has actually been the favored choice to replace galvanized iron pipes (which utilized to be considered very strong, but they were discovered to split under pressure and tend to corrode within a few years). Today, most quality contractors utilize PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as hard water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
