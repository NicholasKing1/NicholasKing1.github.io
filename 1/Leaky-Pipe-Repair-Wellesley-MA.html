<p>Day to day use should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can likewise happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the system in a safe and stable  area. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener does not tip over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you should wait up until after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings.
