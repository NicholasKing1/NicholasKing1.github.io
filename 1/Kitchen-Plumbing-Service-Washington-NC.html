<p>Garbage disposal warranties last an average of 5 years, however they can range in between 2 and ten years. Since the average lifespan of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you might wish to purchase an extended service warranty.

<p>Find out if there are any lead pipes in the home. Houses that were built prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how helpful, is an ecological toxin (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in houses that is not lead based). You might not want to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>

From the lack of suds formation in bathing and laundry applications to the pricey breakdowns in boilers, cooling towers and other equipment that manage water, water solidity is a serious concern.</p>
