<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and somewhere else throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were extensively used in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and conduits, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
