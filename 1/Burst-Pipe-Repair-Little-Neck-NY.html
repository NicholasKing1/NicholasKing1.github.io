Toilet Runs Intermittently - Do not you hate it when the toilet runs 5 minutes after you flushed? It generally means there is a problem with the flapper, or the toilet is leaking water someplace.</p>
<p>To figure out which toilet valve is triggering the difficulty, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into television, there's an issue with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing entirely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water stains and corrosion. However don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
