<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc designed and constructed a smaller design that operated on the very same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise built a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It can cleaning big industrial and municipal sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
