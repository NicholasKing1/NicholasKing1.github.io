<p>Wood pipes were used in London and elsewhere during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
