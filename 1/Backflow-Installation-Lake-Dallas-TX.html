<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
