<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
