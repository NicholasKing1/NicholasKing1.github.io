<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They right away cleared the initial blockage, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
