<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe in Beverly Hills CA</h3>
<p>To replace a gas and repair line expect to pay $ 120 to $1,300. Repairing a gas line is truly replacing a gas line - if it's faulty it needs to be replaced. The cost of gas line replacement is figured out by the cost of labor and products. The difference of the cost depends upon whether the task is a simple gas leak repair or a full replacement of the gas line system. Extra gas line installation for new home appliances are charged individually.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Many house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
