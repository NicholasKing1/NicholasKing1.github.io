<p>As described earlier in the post, carbon monoxide is completely odor-free and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide gas detector. Every home should have carbon monoxide detectors set up at the proper locations. In California, it is a requirement for all multi-family and single houses to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are typically offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all new installations must have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
<p>In addition to the waste disposal unit unit, there are a variety of upgrades and parts that you might need to think about when weighing the waste disposal unit installation cost. For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, decreased or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
