Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this increase can position problems.</p>
