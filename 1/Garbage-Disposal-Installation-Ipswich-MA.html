<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct effect on your security, benefit, convenience, and reliability than your plumbing system. This is incredibly essential! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to push the waste out of your drain system. Present policies limit the amount of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines. We offer 2 kinds of water treatment systems for difficult water: Advantage Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>

<p>Sinkholes do not only occur in your lawn, regrettably, when a sewer line breaks.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this increase can position problems.</p>
