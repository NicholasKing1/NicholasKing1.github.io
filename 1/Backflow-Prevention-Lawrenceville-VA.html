<p>A lot of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather security. As the outer covering of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is called fouling. In some cases it might be essential to filter the water before it gets to your softener to avoid fouling. If the resin becomes fouled, commercial cleaners are offered. Cleaners need to be used according to producer instructions to avoid contamination.</p>
