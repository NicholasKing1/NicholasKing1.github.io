<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
