<p>Backflow preventers need to just be fixed when the information gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has broken down in its performance listed below the established minimum basic. The test procedure is a diagnostic assessment of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if required, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This suggests the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
