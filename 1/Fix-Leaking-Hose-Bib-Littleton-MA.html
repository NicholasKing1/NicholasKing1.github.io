<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the cause of the issue.
