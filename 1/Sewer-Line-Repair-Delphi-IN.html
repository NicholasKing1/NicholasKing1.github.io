<p>The next step we must carry out in the repair process, is to flush the incoming water line. After we have cleaned up the body, and the repaired components are still out of the body, and we have finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or particles. This can be difficult, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system needs to be made use of to assure the line is correctly flushed.</p>
