<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is an individual preference. An authorization is not required for repairs which involve only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided alterations are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A normal water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, wide brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a nearby drain or drywell.</p>

Even if you make it this far, the only thing you can do if your new tank flush valve doesn't work is check for leaks" and make adjustments." Suddenly, a fifty-minute project develops into an indefinitely unresolved problem.</p>
