<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is typical in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately working together that you can achieve this.</p>
