<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the culprit. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely. A chain with too little slack can trigger difficulty too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
