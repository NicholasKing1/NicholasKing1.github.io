<p>Really often the circular blade inside is stuck. DO NOT REACH INSIDE TO FREE IT! Merely insert a long, strong, wood handle (a broom deal with will be adequate) into the opening. Let it rest versus the inside wall, and with force pushing down, turn clockwise up until you feel it turn freely. It may be required to reset the disposal. If so, locate the reset switch on the bottom of the unit. Use any type of drain cleaner to free it if the clog persists.</p>
