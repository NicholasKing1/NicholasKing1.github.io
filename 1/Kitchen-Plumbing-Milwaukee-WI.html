So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers deal with all types of work.

<p>If you see rust just in your warm water, then inspect the status of your hot water heater's anode rod. You might need a professional to do this if you have actually never ever done this on your own. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is probably originating from the within your water heater.
