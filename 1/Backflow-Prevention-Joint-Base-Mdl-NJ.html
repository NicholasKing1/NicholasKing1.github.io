The Pipe Pull method interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with new piping by the usage of a tiny hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into place. All new replacement pipes have a predicted life-span of one hundred years and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another reliable technique is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically eliminates the need for broken pipe elimination. By placing a hardening lining product which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a new pipe is created inside the broken one.</p>
