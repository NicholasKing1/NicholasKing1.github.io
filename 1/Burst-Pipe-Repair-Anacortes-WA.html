Nevertheless, damage such as deep cracks may require a sink replacement.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a severe public health hazard if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, caused the spread of sickness or disease.</p>
