Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
