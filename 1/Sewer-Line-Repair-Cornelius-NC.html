That odor may be coming from your sewer system, which requires repair work immediately. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that gets rid of sewage from your house, launches sewer gas, and regulates air pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually stopped working, it will often need to be replaced instead of repaired. If your pipes are gurgling or releasing nasty smells, you'll know this.</p>
