They are more energy-efficient and can be much safer than routine tank heaters due to the fact that they do not need to constantly heat a tank of water that is under excellent pressure. You also don't have to wait any 'recharge' time with tankless so your warm water is essentially endless. They are now available in gas or electrical options.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as shown in Image 1. If additional pressure on the flapper does not stop the running noise, water is most likely leaving through a split or corroded overflow tube.

Considering that the overflow tube is rarely the cause of a running toilet, we will not cover that repair here.</p>
