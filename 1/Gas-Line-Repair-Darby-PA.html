<p>No other room in a home consists of as many pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. Whether you need electrical, gas, or tankless hot water heater, we have the best one for your house. The most popular and traditional style of hot water heater in Boston and surrounding Massachusetts's neighborhoods is a gas or electric storage tank system.

The filter will eliminate salt from the water, which you can use for drinking and cooking.
