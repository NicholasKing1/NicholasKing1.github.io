<p>The majority of toilets used today run with a standard gravity flushing style, indicating they utilize the force of the gravity to press the clean water into the bowl and after that on into the sewage system.

This system uses a vacuum-assisted flushing mechanism to draw the water into the bowl and down into the sewers. A downside of this device is that it's a lot more tough to unblock your toilet were to become clogged.</p>
