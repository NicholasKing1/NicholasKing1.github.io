<h3>When To Call A Plumber Rensselaer IN</h3>
<p>The most effective way to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>A water conditioner, on the other hand, manages tough water concerns in a more innovative method. It can change the method minerals behave while liquified in the water. While the minerals are still present for any health advantages, they do not build up on surfaces and in plumbing components. Keeping the minerals in the water is an advantage, as long as you can stop the destructive adverse effects.</p>
