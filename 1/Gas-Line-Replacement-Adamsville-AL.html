<p>Spotty meals? Distribution pipes shift to even smaller sized specific service pipes, carrying water to specific houses, house stores, businesses and buildings.

<p>2. Demand-initiated softeners regrow when they sense their softening capability is low as figured out by a preset number gone into by the user.

Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
