<p>A waste disposal unit should not leak. It typically shows wear and tear which is a fair indication that its time is up when this happens. If you think about what you put down the disposal, leaks can be unhygienic and will also ultimately cause strain on other parts of your garbage disposal. The kitchen sink drain might need an easy tightening or a replacement. If the leak is in the pressurized hose spray, you will see the obvious spray. For a leak in the drain pipe, you may need to fill the sink with water prior to examining the pipe beneath.</p>
