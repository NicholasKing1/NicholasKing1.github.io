If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be replaced. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural integrity of the home.</p>
<p>If you get your water from a neighborhood water system, check to see if your neighborhood currently softens the water. Soft water provided by an energy does not need extra softening and may cause deterioration problems for your home.
