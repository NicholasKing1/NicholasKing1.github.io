<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
