<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â€² hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
