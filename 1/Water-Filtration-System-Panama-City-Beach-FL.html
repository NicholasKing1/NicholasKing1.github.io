<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, allowing air to go into the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
