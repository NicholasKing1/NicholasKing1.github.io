<p>Metal alloys are prone to an electro-chemical condition called deterioration. Deterioration can actually consume a metal away triggering the metal to not be as strong as it originally was or alter the tolerances causing parts to not work in a backflow preventer. The impact of rust on a metal alloy must be assessed to determine if the part is usable or must be replaced.</p>
<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, but how do they work and which designs are best for specific applications? Typically the type and installation requirements are spelled out by local statutes and environmental guidelines. Local building codes for example will require a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air gap between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any possible siphon prior to it can take place, avoiding polluting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more complicated and advanced backflow preventers.
