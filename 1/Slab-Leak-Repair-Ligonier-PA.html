Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A lot of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really hazardous if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the proper precautions.</p>
