TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are geared up with this kind of camera to identify and repair the drain issue.

Make certain you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe gets in the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
