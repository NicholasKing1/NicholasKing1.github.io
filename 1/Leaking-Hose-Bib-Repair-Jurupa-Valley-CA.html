With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the recently cleaned main drain. By including perseverence and persistence the job was done to my total fulfillment.</p>

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of home centers bring only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models.
