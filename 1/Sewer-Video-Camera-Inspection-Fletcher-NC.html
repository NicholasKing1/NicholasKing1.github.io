For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain.

Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly flow into the drain pipe in addition to the rest of your wastewater.</p>
