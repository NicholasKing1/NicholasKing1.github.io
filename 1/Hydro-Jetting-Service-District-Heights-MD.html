<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that undergo fouling, use or fatigue. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. Therefore, all backflow preventers have to be evaluated occasionally to guarantee they are operating correctly. A visual check of air gaps suffices, but mechanical backflow preventers need to be tested with properly calibrated gauge devices.</p>
