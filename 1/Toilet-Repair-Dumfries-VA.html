<p>Water softeners leaks are mainly caused because of a concern at the point of installation or since of maintenance. When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated correctly. If the bypass valve is split, it can likewise cause the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or replaced in time.
