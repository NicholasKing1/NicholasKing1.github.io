<p>Every water heater we install has been tested under the most extreme water temperatures and was constructed to last a very long time. When your existing hot water heater starts failing, a new installation might cost money up front, however it can save you hundreds and even thousands of dollars in the long run. Effectiveness and durability are essential parts of every water heater we sell.

<p>Maintenance is another factor to consider. While you can acquire models with special features that do whatever but include the salt, you will spend for each extra feature. The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm guarantee that the unique feature will not fail. Depending upon the water source, you might have to filter turbid water or decontaminate bacteria-laden water-all prior to it even reaches the softening unit. Finally, if you own a septic tank, you need to think about the extra load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates indicate that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regrowth cycle. This may or may not trigger hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
<p>For the most part, an absence of warm water is caused by a faulty circuit breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. The dip tube inside the tank might be cracked if the water is lukewarm. Scalding water is usually the outcome of a broken pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water is dangerous and should be instantly attended to by a qualified plumbing professional.</p>
