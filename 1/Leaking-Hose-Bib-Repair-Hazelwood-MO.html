<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather defense. As the external finishing of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â² hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
