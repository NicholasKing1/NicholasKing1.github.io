<p>Then attach the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your unit is outlet-ready-- pay attention to this part-- make certain your disposal switch is in the off" position before you plug the brand-new unit in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pushed against it will result in decapitation, it might scare a number of years off your life. Not that I would know from experience.</p>
<p>The drains in the typical home get constant use. Hair, food scraps, soap residue, and other debris can gradually build up gradually. The drain will gradually slow until it becomes entirely clogged. Chemical drain cleaners offered in shops have limited efficiency.
