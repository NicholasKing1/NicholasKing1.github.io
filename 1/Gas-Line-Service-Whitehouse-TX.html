<p>There are a number of telltale signs that will let you know you have a gas line leak in your home, and it is necessary to take notice of them. The gas pipe might be pierced or damaged if you discover a strong smell that resembles rotten eggs.

<p>A minimum of once every three months, drain water from the tank. In time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct performance, and draining a gallon or two helps get rid of the sediment.

To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to think about repiping your whole house when you spot a leak.</p>
