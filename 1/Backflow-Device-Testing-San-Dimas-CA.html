<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board advises the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections regarding the administration of Post 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, consisting of licensing. Backsiphonage happens when there is an unfavorable pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a personal water system into the public water system.
