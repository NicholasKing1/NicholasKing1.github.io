<p>State you decide to go that route. The next question is whether you can install it yourself. Put it in this manner, if you're an experienced convenient individual, however you've never handled this specific repair, you can probably do it, supplying you do your research.

<p>If there's an existing disposal, utilize the useful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink. It will suit the holes on bottom piece of the bracket.
