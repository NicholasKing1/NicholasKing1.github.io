<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to avoid backflow. The basic methods of preventing backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The standard system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow.

A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>

Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's harder to remove.</p>
