<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Mantua OH</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
