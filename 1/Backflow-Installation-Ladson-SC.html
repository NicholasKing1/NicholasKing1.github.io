<p>Backflow preventers are critical for creating a safe water system system. No matter which model you choose, all water softeners need to be appropriately kept. The salt water service need to be mixed and kept in the brine tank. Routine clogging of the resin also needs unique attention. For example, if the raw water supply is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, typical backwashing with water will solve this issue. If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Likewise, bacteria and fungis also form mats in the resin that reduce its efficiency. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or occasionally cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these problems. However, check out the manufacturer's instructions prior to including any chemicals to the system.</p>
