<p>New homes built with copper pipes are particularly prone to corrosive water conditions since the copper pipes have not had a chance to become layered within.

See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Numerous brand-new homes are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>

<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Windsor Locks CT</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
