<p>In this scenario, filthy water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Worms for watering systems: Citizens found parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the air pressure breaker malfunctioned on a privately owned underground lawn sprinkler. During a water pressure drop, the vacuum in the system sucked some water from the sprinkler into the city water. The house owner discovered worms swimming in the bathtub while filling it to bathe his kid.</p>
<p>Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water originating from your water appliances? This is an excellent indicator that your pipes may be rusting from the inside and for that reason, need to be replaced. Bear in mind that if the rust-colored water only includes warm water, the cause might be a rusted out water heater-- not your house's piping.</p>
