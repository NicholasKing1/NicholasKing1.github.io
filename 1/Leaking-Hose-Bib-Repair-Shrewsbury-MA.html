<p>When the data collected from the field test indicates the assembly has deteriorated in its performance below the established minimum basic, backflow preventers must just be repaired. The test treatment is a diagnostic evaluation of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to fulfill this minimum basic, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if necessary, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This means the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
