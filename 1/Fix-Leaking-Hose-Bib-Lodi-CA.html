<p>Water solidity is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the difference on your skin is due to the fact that soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term firmness" came from ... it's difficult to clean in.</p>

While these prevail indications that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily imply repiping is the only solution.
