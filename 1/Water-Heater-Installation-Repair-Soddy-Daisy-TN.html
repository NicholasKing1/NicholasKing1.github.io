<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first shot utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Much of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely harmful if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the appropriate preventative measures.</p>
