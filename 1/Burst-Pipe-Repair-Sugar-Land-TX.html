<p>Often called an auger, this useful tool can clear clogs that might be stuck further down the system. You'll need to disassemble the drainpipe and P-trap that runs below the kitchen sink to expose the stub pipe" or stubout" that travels behind the cabinet wall. This is where you insert the snake into the pipe until you feel resistance to separate the clog.</p>
<p>In municipal water system systems, water is generally maintained at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to flow to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your home or company. When the pressure drops for some factor such as might occur when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to combat a fire or a water main breaks or some other circumstance takes place, infected water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an event, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention technique made use of.

The proper backflow prevention device is required if an air space is not possible. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water provider.</p>
