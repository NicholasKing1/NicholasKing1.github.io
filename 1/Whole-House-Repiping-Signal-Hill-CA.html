<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200).
