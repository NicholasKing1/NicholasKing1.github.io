Provided there isn't a tank failure, normally a commercial water heater can be repaired, but is it worth fixing? Only after answering the following questions should you address repair or replace. Do you understand how many years old your hot water heater is? Do you know how many years it's rated for? If it is close to the variety of years the water heater was rated for, consider replacement rather of repair.</p>
<p>Back-siphonage is backflow triggered by an unfavorable pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a Public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. The effect resembles drinking water through a straw. Back-siphonage can happen when there is a stoppage of water supply due to close-by fire fighting, a break in a water main, and so on</p>
