<h3>Unclog Drains, Toilets and Sewers With The Help of Harrisburg NC Plumbers</h3>
<p>When we install a brand-new sink, we take care to make sure that it is done correctly with no leakages that could cause water damage in the long-run. Our team can help you with that too if your kitchen has already suffered from water damage and the resulting effects of mold, mildew, and rot. We can even repair or install a brand name brand-new garbage disposal so your kitchen is not just gorgeous, but it is practical too.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers bring just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you may have to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug kit that I purchased independently from the disposal unit. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
