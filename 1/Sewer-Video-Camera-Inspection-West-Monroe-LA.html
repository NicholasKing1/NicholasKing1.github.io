When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water passes through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it should be restored (cleaned). Salt is normally utilized in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
