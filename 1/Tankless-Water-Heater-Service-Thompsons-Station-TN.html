<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system must be continually monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
