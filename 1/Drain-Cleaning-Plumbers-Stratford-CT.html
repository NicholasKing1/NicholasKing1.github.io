Salt ions are held loosely and are changed quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this process, totally free" sodium ions are launched into the water. The time between charging cycles depends on the firmness of the water, the quantity of water used, the size of the system and the capacity of the exchange media to remove solidity.</p>
