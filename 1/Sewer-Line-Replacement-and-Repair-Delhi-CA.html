Funneling happens when the inbound difficult water follows a narrow course through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened. If you have actually ever noticed that the busier your company is, the better your detergent works, the perpetrator might be a large softener.</p>
<p>Aside from these 2 important parts, there are a myriad of small, possibly less crucial things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more rapidly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
