<p>Backpressure is created when pressure in a water supply goes beyond the pressure in the drinkable system providing the cosmetics water. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the two systems. Possible impurities can then enter the drinkable water system. The best method to lower build-up is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is specifically hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>
