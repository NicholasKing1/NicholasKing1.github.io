<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Elizabeth CO</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system must be constantly monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>

<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health hazard if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for efficiency, in addition to checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
