<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system should be constantly kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>Gas is an affordable and clean-burning method to running home appliances and heating houses. There are still some downsides, nevertheless, as a natural gas leak can cause damage to your house, lead to health dangers and worse. To effectively keep your gas lines, you must have them periodically inspected by a licensed plumber to help determine and repair any corrosion and leak that could be causing risky conditions.</p>
