<h3>How To Repair A Leaking Kitchen Faucet in Kannapolis NC</h3>
<p>From tubs and showers clogged with hair and soap buildup to sinks filled with tooth paste and other gunk, bathrooms present numerous challenges when it concerns keeping drains clear and totally free. Even toilets can be overwhelmed with toilet tissue or non-flushable products. Regardless of the challenge, Roto-Rooter plumbers have all the equipment required to address clogged bathroom drains and can offer professional sewer cleaning and drain cleaning company.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of house centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>

The technicians and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you always have a copy for your insurance real estate agent, company or city inspector.</p>
