<p>Regular leaks: Leakages coming from your water heater are never an excellent indication.

Its sole task is to prevent drinking water from being infected due to backflow.</p>
<p>Softeners generally remove calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are typically described as 'firmness minerals'.
