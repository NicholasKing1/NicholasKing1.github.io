<p>The next step we must perform in the repair process, is to flush the incoming water line. After we have cleaned the body, and the repaired parts are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet shut down to flush any rust or particles. This can be challenging, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is very important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be utilized to ensure the line is correctly flushed.</p>

It is the second highest energy consuming area of a home, beside cooling and heating.
