Sodium ions are held loosely and are replaced quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. During this process, complimentary" sodium ions are launched into the water. The time in between recharging cycles depends on the solidity of the water, the quantity of water utilized, the size of the unit and the capacity of the exchange media to get rid of hardness.</p>
<p>In community water supply systems, water is normally kept at a significant pressure to enable water to stream to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your house or business. When the pressure drops for some factor such as may happen when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to combat a water or a fire main breaks or some other circumstance takes place, contaminated water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an incident, there requires to be some kind of backflow prevention technique utilized. The best and most safe kind of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). If an air space is not possible, then the correct backflow prevention device is required.
