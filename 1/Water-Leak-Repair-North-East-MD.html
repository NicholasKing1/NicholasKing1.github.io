When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated appropriately. If the bypass valve is split, it can also cause the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed over time.
