I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
