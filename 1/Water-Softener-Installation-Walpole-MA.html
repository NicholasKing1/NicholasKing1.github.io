<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Walpole MA</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does take place more frequently than you believe! Often it happens at night when you do not observe the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
