<p>To determine which toilet valve is causing the difficulty, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into the tube, there's an issue with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to drip into the bowl. That slow, continuous outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing entirely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water spots and rust. But don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
