<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Guideline, General. Within the building envelope including listed below grade, if less than 10-percent (small) of the existing piping for a fixture, sub-system, or system group is replaced, an authorization and inspection shall not be required. This shall not preclude the licensee from acquiring authorizations and inspections for such work if so wanted.</p>
<p>Softeners primarily remove calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently described as 'firmness minerals'.

Your water heater must be flushed once a year. It might have up to 8 inches of sediment at the bottom of the tank if you have a 15‐year‐old water heater that's never been flushed. That indicates 8 fewer inches of warm water, not to discuss the fact that your tap water is being heated up in a tank with calcium, scale, rust, dirt, iron, and sulfuric‐smelling bacteria.</p>
