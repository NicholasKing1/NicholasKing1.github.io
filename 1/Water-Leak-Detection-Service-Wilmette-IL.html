<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Wilmette IL</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>To determine if your house is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Often, it gets in the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is connected to completion of the water pipe. Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have actually found cases where the copper pipe gets in the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
