<p>Sewer lines can fail for a range of reasons, including poor soil conditions, obstructions from grease and gunk, and corrosion. Even bushes and trees can trigger problems for sewer lines, especially in older areas where clay pipe might have been utilized.

<p>Install very economical low-flow aerators for bathroom and kitchen faucets. Entire house filtration systems can remove chlorine and other damaging chemicals from all of your water sources and improve your water taste, quality, and color for drinking, bathing, cleaning, and washing.

<p>A pressure vacuum breaker (PVB) is considered a testable backflow preventer, but it is also extremely unusual. They were manufactured so as to give the plumber a testable vacuum breaker device. As for the danger, this device covers dangerous as well as non-hazardous scenarios. But simply as with the AVB it can not deal with back pressure, only back siphonage.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to avoid backflow. The standard ways of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The fundamental mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report should be supplied to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in difficult water can trigger a bad smell and taste. When you add a water softener, it gets rid of the mineral content to produce odor free drinking water that tastes good.</p>
