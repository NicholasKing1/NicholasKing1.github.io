<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>This is the timeless question that lots of house owners ask themselves. Is it much better to repair their pipes or repipe them and begin fresh? The response is completely depending on your unique situation. For example, if your pipe is experiencing a small leak however remains in otherwise good condition, we would suggest repairing it. Nevertheless, if the pipe is continuously leaking and needs frequent repairs, we would advise repiping.

<p>The Final Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that regulates water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't set up effectively, you may experience a regularly or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>
