<p>Anti-Scale Gadgets: Some hot water heater promote features that decrease mineral scale buildup by churning water in the bottom of the tank. Features such as these add cost, and aren't that effective. Your best technique is to get the water heater with the 12 year warranty. Chlorinated Polyvinylchloride Piping (CPVC) piping materials cost from $0.40 to $1.56 per linear foot. A popular replacement product for metal pipes, CPVC pipe is stiff plastic piping that has thick walls and can be used for cold and hot drinking pipes. CPVC is simple to install and meets the most rigorous building codes.</p>
<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be customized to your water requires. Your EcoWater Pro will evaluate your water to determine the best water treatment for your home. A single tank or cabinet-style system needs less space because the softener's brine tank nests within the salt tank. The CareSoft ® system was established with the same innovative engineering as the Pro and Elite models, with resin that provides high-performance hardness removal you can count on for years to come.</p>
