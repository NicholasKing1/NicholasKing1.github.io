<p>EcoWater's elite water softener system is our conditioner, available in a single-tank "cabinet" design. It is extremely advised for either community or well water products. No one wishes to stroll into a bathroom or a kitchen and find a sink filled with black gunk. We need our faucets and sinks to be functioning correctly in order to support safe and sanitary living conditions as well.</p>
<p>Water hardness is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the difference on your skin is due to the fact that soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue. This leads to the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. And that's where the term solidity" came from ... it's hard to clean in.</p>
