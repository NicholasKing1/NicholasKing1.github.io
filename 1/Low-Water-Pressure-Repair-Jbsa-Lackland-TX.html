<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler typically are installed in locations where water could cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

In either case, scalding water is dangerous and must be immediately resolved by an experienced plumbing professional.</p>
