<h3>Blocked Sewer in High Point NC - Some Vital Info You Should Know</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
