<p>Improvement plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
