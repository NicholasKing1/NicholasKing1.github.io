<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your house. Then that generally means that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience obstructions in numerous drains at once in your house. This can occur in several areas and any combination of drains. For example, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from several drain lines in your home.</p>
<p>5. Pour warm water down your drain after using the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, wash your drain with a little bit of hot water. Whether tree roots have made their way into your pipes or you flushed something you shouldn't have, a clogged toilet is never a pleasant experience. Luckily, you do not constantly need the assistance of a professional to fix it.</p>
