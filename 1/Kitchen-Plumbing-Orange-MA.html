<p>Sealed and effectively functioning pipes will conserve you money every month on your gas expense. Efficiency is essential, and you will conserve money when you are just using what you need rather of needlessly losing excess gas due to leakages.

<p>To determine if your house is a poly home," start with the outside. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it enters the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is attached to the end of the water pipe.
