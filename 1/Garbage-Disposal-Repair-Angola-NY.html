The gas hot water heater use gas or LPG to warm the water. The gas designs are likewise less expensive to run than the electrical types and are a preferred for commercial and residential functions.

In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, enabling air to enter the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient climatic standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
