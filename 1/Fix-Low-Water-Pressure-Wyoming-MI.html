The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were extensively used in the USA during the 20th century.

Locking of nearby rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
