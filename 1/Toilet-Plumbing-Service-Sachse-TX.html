<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically two layers of defense. The device allows water to push the check valves open when water is coming into the building, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the incorrect way. There are two different kinds of testable backflow prevention gadgets that are frequently specified-- a decreased pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device.
