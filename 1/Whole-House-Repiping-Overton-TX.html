<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may have to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug kit that I bought individually from the disposal system. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
