<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
