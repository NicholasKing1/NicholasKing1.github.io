The company should get a permit prior to trenching. How typically a backflow preventer requires to be tested depends upon its type. There are 2 main sort of backflow preventers, and each has its own maintenance requirements. Double check valve assembly (DCV) and decreased pressure zone assembly (RPZ) devices are most commonly used in commercial facilities.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, heater, and dishwasher, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these little deposits are safe, however gradually they build up and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically restrict the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
