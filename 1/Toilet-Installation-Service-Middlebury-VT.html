<p>Water isn't hot enough. Due to the fact that you may put up with it for weeks or even months prior to deciding it needs to be fixed, this can be frustrating. Luckily it's generally a fast, easy fix. We see this a lot on standard electrical water heaters, which utilize a set of electric heating components to heat the tank. Often, among the two burns out, resulting in water that's not hot but warm. If this isn't it, we can replace it or identify the real issue.</p>
<p>1. Install a hair-stopper - Hair-stoppers work just as their name implies. They stop long hair from getting in and blocking your shower drain.
