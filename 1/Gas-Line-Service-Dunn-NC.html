<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
