If the hot water heater has been maintained with yearly flush service, it can likely last beyond its basic warranty. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to possible contamination or poorer quality water, need a backflow prevention device.</p>
<p>While many hot water heater problems can be successfully fixed, some concerns will demand complete water heater replacement. If your hot water heater is past its typical lifespan (generally anywhere from 8 to ten years or longer if you have a tankless water heater) or if it has a major leak or comprehensive rust, it might be time to consider replacement.</p>

While these prevail indications that precede repiping services, they do not always indicate repiping is the only option.
