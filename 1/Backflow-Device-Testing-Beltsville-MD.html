<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
