Because pressure is lost during these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will flow backwards into the city water lines. Although an EcoWater dealership does not support your area currently, we are happy to help you with an alternative service. You can order, with totally free shipping, a top name-brand filtration or softener system by shopping at Any installation services below can then assist with installation, or you can merely install the system yourself.</p>
