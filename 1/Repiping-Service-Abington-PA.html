<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health hazard if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of illness or illness.</p>

You'll probably notification lower water pressure in the shower or when washing meals. The best service is to replace your plumbing with new pipes that don't have accumulation.</p>
