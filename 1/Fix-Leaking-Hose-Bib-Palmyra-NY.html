<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet.
