<p>Backsiphonage can take place when there is an unexpected reduction in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as during fire combating or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This reversal can create a suction effect and draw potential impurities into the safe and clean (drinking) water supply. Tank hot water heater are frequently found in most houses. Their elements are an insulated tank, usually holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water till it's required.

<p>You live in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never changed its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done quickly.

If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
