<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, but how do they work and which styles are best for specific applications? Often the type and installation requirements are defined by ecological regulations and local statutes. Local building codes for instance will require a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air gap in between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any prospective siphon prior to it can take place, preventing polluting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more complex and advanced backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical gadgets set up to prevent backflow range from the relatively basic to the complex and extremely advanced.</p>
