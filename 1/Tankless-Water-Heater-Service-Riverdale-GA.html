<p>Place the flange on the top side of the sink, and connect the fastening system on the underside (Image 1). It is helpful to apply pressure on the flange from above utilizing a second set of hands or a heavy object. This will keep the flange in place while attaching the fastening system below. Ensure the plumber's putty is noticeably exuding beyond the edge of the flange all around (Image 2). As soon as a complete seal has actually formed, get rid of the excess putty with a rag.</p>
<p>Though it's not constantly necessary, in some cases the plumber may need to repair or update electrical wiring to power the new garbage disposal. This generally costs an extra $50 to $100+.
