<p>We genuinely care about our consumers and the services that we offer. As tough water goes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with sodium ions (Figure 1). Salt ions are held loosely and are replaced easily by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this procedure, free" sodium ions are launched into the water. The time between recharging cycles depends on the hardness of the water, the amount of water utilized, the size of the system and the capacity of the exchange media to remove hardness.</p>
<p>Mixing vaporized salt with rock salt is not advised, as this could clog the softening reservoir. It is recommended that you allow your unit to go empty of one type of salt prior to adding another to avoid the event of any problems. In any case, when you're planning a water heater replacement, play it safe. If you need an authorization, call your local department of inspections and ask. And make certain a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
