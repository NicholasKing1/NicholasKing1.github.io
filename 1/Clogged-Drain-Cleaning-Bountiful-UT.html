<p>Does it seem like your drains are constantly sluggish or clogged? Frequently, this is triggered by built-up sediment and other products that are triggering a clog in your sewer drain. Where other drain cleaning and plumbing companies will try to charge you a leg and an arm to dig up and clean your sewer line, Northwest Drain Station provides hydro jetting, a highly effective option for dislodging persistent products that have actually adhered to the walls of your pipeline, bring back a healthy circulation to your drains.</p>
<p>The Last Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that manages water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't set up appropriately, you might experience an often or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in wasted water.</p>
