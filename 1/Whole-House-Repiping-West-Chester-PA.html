<p>Most softeners have actually a bypass developed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to offer some kind of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you pick does not have a bypass, then it's smart to build one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to maintain the unit.</p>
<p>Common fixes do not fix the issue. It's most likely a concern you can't fix without professional help if it appears you're constantly experiencing plumbing problems. A licensed plumber can not just spot that reason for the issue but safely repair or replace your main sewer line if needed.
