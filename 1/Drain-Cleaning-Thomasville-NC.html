Backflow into a public water system can pollute or contaminate the water in that system (i.e., backflow into a public water supply can make the water in that system hazardous or unusable to consume), and each water supplier has a duty to provide water that is usable and safe to consume under all foreseeable scenarios. Moreover, consumers usually have outright faith that water provided to them through a public water system is constantly safe to drink. For these reasons, your water district must take precautions to safeguard its public water supply versus backflow.</p>
<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if relevant).
