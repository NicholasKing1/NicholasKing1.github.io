<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial blockage, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
