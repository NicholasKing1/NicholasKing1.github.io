<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads.
