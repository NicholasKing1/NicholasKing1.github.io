<h3>Useful Tips for Water Heater Repair in North Arlington NJ</h3>
<p>Backflow is dangerous due to the fact that it can contaminate the general public drinking supply with contaminants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and hazardous chemicals.

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many home centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
