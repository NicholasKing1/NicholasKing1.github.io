<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.

If things need to be customized, replaced, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours required and therefore the total expenses.

At the least, it would have been a very expensive option.</p>
