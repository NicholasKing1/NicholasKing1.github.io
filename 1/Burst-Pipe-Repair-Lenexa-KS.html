When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have actually never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing major and regular leaks. We find that repiping can in fact be the more affordable and much better long-term solution if you do have frequent leaks.</p>

In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they should be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a huge warning that something more major is incorrect with them.</p>
