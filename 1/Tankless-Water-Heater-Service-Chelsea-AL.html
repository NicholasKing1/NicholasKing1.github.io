<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow instructions within a piping system that is brought on by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of regular flow in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the issue. You may have to look into utilizing a high pressure water system to get rid of the clog.
