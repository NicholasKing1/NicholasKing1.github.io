<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that go through fouling, wear or fatigue. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be evaluated occasionally to ensure they are functioning effectively. A visual check of air spaces suffices, but mechanical backflow preventers have to be evaluated with correctly calibrated gauge devices.</p>
