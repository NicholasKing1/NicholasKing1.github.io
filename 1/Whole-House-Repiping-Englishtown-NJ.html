Fire protection system are designed to match the hazard that exists in the locations they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be extremely various, we need to comprehend that the fire defense system for any installation needs to be developed and installed to meet that particular hazard or need. An airplane garage will need an extremely different fire protection system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow protection requirements for these two examples would also vary significantly.</p>
