Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself.

<h3>What To Do During Emergency Plumbing Situations Ozone Park NY</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
