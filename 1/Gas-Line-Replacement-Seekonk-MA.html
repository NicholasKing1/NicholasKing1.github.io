<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
