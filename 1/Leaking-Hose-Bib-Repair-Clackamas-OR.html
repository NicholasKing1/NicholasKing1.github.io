<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth automatically begins. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regeneration typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
