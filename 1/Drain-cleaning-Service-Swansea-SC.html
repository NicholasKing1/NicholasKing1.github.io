<h3>Well Systems and Well Pumps in Swansea South Carolina</h2>
<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>Difficult water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so just softened water passes through to your house. When the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is typically used in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
