The standard system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
