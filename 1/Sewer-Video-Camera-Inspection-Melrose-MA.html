<p>Deterioration is an intricate phenomenon and there are numerous elements that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that accelerate rust Also, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective form of rust control. Hence, considering all these factors, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
