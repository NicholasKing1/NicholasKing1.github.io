<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular occurrence, however it does occur more often than you believe! When you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, typically it takes place at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes construction tasks easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical reason for backflow. Fire engine use substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Badly set up gas lines cause gas leaks. Gas leaks are costly to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself project. The gas lines have to be adjusted to the best levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy states that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the second highest energy consuming area of a house, beside cooling and heating. The quantity of minerals liquified in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may need to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug kit that I bought separately from the disposal system. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
