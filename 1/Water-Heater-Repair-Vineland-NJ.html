To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is common in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
