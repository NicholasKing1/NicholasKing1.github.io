After we have actually cleaned up the body, and the repaired components are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet shut down to flush any rust or particles. This can be difficult, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is essential that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system needs to be utilized to guarantee the line is appropriately flushed.</p>

The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
