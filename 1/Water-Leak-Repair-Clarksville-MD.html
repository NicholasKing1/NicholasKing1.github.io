<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Clarksville MD</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leaks happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these problems.</p>
