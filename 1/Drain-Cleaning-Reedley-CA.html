<p>After showing up after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but declared they would not take obligation if it dripped now due to the fact that of some undefined curiosity in how my sink was assembled. After they provided me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, since I never ever wish to see this company again.</p>
