<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
