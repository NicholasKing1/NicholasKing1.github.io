<p>When choosing the appropriate system defense there are numerous considerations we need to take a look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation must be taken a look at on a private basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of lawn sprinkler consists of the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire protection system are created to match the danger that exists in the areas they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be very various, we need to comprehend that the fire defense system for any installation needs to be developed and set up to meet that particular risk or need. An aircraft hangar will need an extremely different fire protection system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow security requirements for these 2 examples would also differ greatly.</p>
