You wish to confirm that any seals you made are tight. Turn on the disposal during this action to ensure it runs properly. Gas Devices Malfunctioning: Another typical sign that your gas line might be damaged is if you see the malfunctioning of appliances in your home that are powered by gas. For example, if your gas stove and hot water heater stop working at the same time, you most likely have a gas line issue.</p>
<p>Next comes the metal install ring and rubber cushion install (or cushion ring). Their correct orientation will be identified. These two pieces have complementary grooves that when properly fitted together hold the install ring and disposal in place. Holding the mount ring at the topmost part of the flange, work the cushion mount over the bottom of the flange, making sure that the rubber of the cushion install is completely and securely locking into the groove on the bottom of the flange. When set up properly, you should not have the ability to get rid of the cushion install without significant pulling and stretching, and the install ring needs to turn easily around it.</p>
