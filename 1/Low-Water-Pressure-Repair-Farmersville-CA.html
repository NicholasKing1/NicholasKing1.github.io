<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were timely and very responsive to send me a bid which was extremely competitive. They were extremely professional and did a remarkable task. I would certainly call them once again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration only appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust most likely exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is naturally still an issue that needs to be handled immediately (you'll likely need a brand-new hot water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
