<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Kittanning PA</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
