When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing frequent and significant leakages, you could be in need of water line repiping. We discover that repiping can in fact be the more affordable and much better long-lasting option if you do have regular leaks.</p>
