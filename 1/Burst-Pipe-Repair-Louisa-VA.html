<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede versus the required instructions of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can become infected. There is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health hazard if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, as well as checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
