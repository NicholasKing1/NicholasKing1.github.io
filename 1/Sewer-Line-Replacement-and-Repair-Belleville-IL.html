<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Belleville IL</h3>
<p>Corrosion is an intricate phenomenon and there are many factors that accelerate rust in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that speed up deterioration Also, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable kind of corrosion control. Thus, thinking about all these elements, along with results from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
