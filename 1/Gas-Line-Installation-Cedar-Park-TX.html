<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has space to hang on to positive ions. The fresh media begins by hanging on to the weaker charged salt ions. As tough water travels through your water softener tank, the stronger charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Considering that the hardness minerals have a greater positive charge than the sodium, they will knock the sodium ions off and take their location.</p>
<p>A water conditioner, on the other hand, deals with hard water concerns in a more innovative way. It can change the method minerals behave while dissolved in the water. While the minerals are still present for any health advantages, they do not build up on surfaces and in plumbing fixtures. Keeping the minerals in the water is a good idea, as long as you can stop the damaging adverse effects.</p>
