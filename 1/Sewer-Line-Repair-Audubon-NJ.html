<p>A pressure vacuum breaker (PVB) is considered a testable backflow preventer, however it is likewise extremely uncommon. They were made so regarding offer the plumber a testable vacuum breaker device. When it comes to the danger, this device covers harmful in addition to non-hazardous circumstances.

Put it this way, if you're a knowledgeable handy person, but you have actually never ever managed this particular repair, you can probably do it, offering you do your homework.
