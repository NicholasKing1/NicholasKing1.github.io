The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively used in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood.
