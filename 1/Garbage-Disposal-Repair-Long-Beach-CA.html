<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Long Beach CA</h3>
<p>However, due to the fact that a waste disposal unit is only expected to last in between 10 to 12 years, a replacement will become needed. Due to the fact that their blades will rapidly end up being dull, this is particularly true for disposals that are used regularly. Another time that a replacement will be necessary is when the motor stops functioning entirely.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
