The plumbers at Clarke & Rush are specialists in repipe jobs, and certified to help you make this crucial choice. We will guarantee you understand your alternatives, the disadvantages and benefits, and make a suggestion so you can make an informed option. A waste disposal unit typically plugs into a 120-volt GFCI (ground-fault circuit interruptor) outlet under the sink.

This can help reduce the stress on your plumbing from food particles and particles and avoid prospective blockages and problems.
