<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were timely and extremely responsive to send me a bid which was extremely competitive. They were really professional and did a remarkable job.

<p>Obvious odor. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the yard, basement, or throughout your house or business place, offer us a call. That smell may be coming from your sewer system, which needs repair work right now. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your home, releases sewer gas, and controls air pressure in the waste-system pipes has failed, it will typically need to be changed rather than repaired. You'll understand this if your pipes are gurgling or producing foul odors.</p>
<p>While many hot water heater problems can be effectively fixed, some problems will necessitate complete hot water heater replacement. If your hot water heater is past its typical life-span (generally anywhere from 8 to ten years or longer if you have a tankless hot water heater) or if it has a significant leak or comprehensive rust, it may be time to think about replacement.</p>

Trenchless repair will generally have to do with half the cost of standard work. This is why it is necessary to have a professional plumbing service on hand to identify which service is best.</p>
<p>Older toilets generally utilize 3.5 gallons or more per flush, particularly if they were manufactured prior to 1994. Newer models just utilize 1.6 gallons per flush while still providing the same flushing power. More recent toilet styles are environmentally-friendly and have a dual flushing system which only uses 0.9 gallons per flush. Tankless water heaters: These water heaters heat faster than conventional hot water heater. They also use up less space considering that they don't need a tank.</p>
