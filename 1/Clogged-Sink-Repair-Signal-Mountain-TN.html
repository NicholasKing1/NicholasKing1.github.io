<p>Surprise water leakages are typically stressful and have Potentially Major Repercussions. Replacing your flapper might require slightly various actions than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3).

To find a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Turn off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but possibilities are you'll find one of the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
<p>While city water does get dealt with, it is provided for purposes of removing bacterial concerns and making the water drinkable. These are certainly top priorities for a town and its citizens but tough water can negatively affect faucets and devices in a house.
