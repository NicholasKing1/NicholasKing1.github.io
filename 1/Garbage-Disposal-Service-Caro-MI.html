<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will accumulate in numerous parts of the plumbing system, most typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves.

If this doesn't work, you might need to replace one of your toilet's components, normally the flapper. There may also be a problem with the chain connected to the flapper or the float ball.
