<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, however how do they work and which styles are best for certain applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are spelled out by ecological policies and local statutes. Local building regulations for instance will need a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air gap between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any potential siphon before it can occur, avoiding infecting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more complex and advanced backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical devices set up to avoid backflow range from the fairly simple to the complicated and extremely sophisticated.</p>
