<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
