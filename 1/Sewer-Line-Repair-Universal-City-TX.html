<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so just softened water goes through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be restored (cleaned). Salt is usually utilized in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
