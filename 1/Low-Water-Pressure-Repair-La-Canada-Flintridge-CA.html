Even if the problem comes from with the municipal system, it's still clever to bring in the professionals to limit the damage to your home.</p>
<p>Inspections avoid a high portion of plumbing emergency situations. There are some things you can do for your hot water heater to assist it run properly. It is important to ensure there is always two feet of clearance around it. You need to also drain about 25 percent of your tank regularly (a couple of times each year).
