The particles of calcium integrate, become much heavier than the remainder of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next step of the treatment procedure. Flexible gas lines are usually preferable to inflexible lines, especially in areas where earthquakes are more typical and for the connection between the supply and device.
