That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
