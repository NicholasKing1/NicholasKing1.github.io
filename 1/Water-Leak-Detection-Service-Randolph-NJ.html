<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Randolph NJ</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system must be constantly kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
