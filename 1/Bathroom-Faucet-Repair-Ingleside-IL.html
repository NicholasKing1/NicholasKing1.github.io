<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many house centers carry only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can purchase designs with unique functions that do whatever but include the salt, you will spend for each extra feature. The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm guarantee that the special feature will not stop working. Depending on the water source, you may need to filter turbid water or disinfect bacteria-laden water-all prior to it even reaches the softening system. Lastly, if you own a septic system, you must consider the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates show that about 50 gallons of water are utilized for each regrowth cycle. This might or may not cause hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
<p>Other indications you might need to repipe include rust in your water supply, low water pressure, and damp spots in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these are common signs that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily mean repiping is the only solution. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will take a look at the problem to figure out the very best course of action.</p>
