You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't installed effectively, you might experience an often or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in squandered water.</p>
