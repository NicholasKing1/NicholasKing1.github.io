Depending upon how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite an annoyance-- for its many intended usages around your house.</p>
