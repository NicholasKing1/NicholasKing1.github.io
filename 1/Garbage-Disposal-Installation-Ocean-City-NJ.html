<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Ocean City NJ</h3>

<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
