<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual preference. A permit is not needed for repairs which include only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages provided modifications are not made in the existing piping or components. A normal water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, large salt water tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a neighboring drain or drywell.</p>
