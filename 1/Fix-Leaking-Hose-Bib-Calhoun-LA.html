<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
