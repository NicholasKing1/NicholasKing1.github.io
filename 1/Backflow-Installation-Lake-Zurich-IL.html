<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
