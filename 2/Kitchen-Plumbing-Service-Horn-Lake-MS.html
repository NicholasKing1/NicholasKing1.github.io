Expense 41-15 (PDF): The Present Plumbing and Gasfitting Code of Baltimore County was approved by the County Council on May 4, 2015 with an effective date of July 1, 2015. This code adopted the PHCC National Requirement Plumbing Code - Illustrated, 2015 edition, the NFPA 54 National Fuel Gas Code, 2015 edition and the NFPA 58 Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code, 2014 edition.</p>

<p>It may be time to get it replaced if your water heater has actually needed numerous repairs over the last few years. A good guideline for water heaters is this: since the life expectancy of the average hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. If the cost of a repair is over half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your hot water heater.</p>
