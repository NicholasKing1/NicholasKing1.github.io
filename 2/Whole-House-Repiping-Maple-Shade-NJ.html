<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Maple Shade NJ</h3>

<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were prompt and very responsive to send me a quote which was very competitive. They were very professional and did a remarkable task. I would definitely call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration just appears when warm water is being utilized, then the rust most likely exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is naturally still an issue that needs to be handled right now (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) but not one that requires repiping.</p>
