<p>Improperly installed gas lines cause gas leakages. Gas leaks are costly to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself task. The gas lines need to be calibrated to the right levels by a certified professional. The United States Department of Energy states that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a home, next to heating & cooling. The quantity of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>
<p>By replacing the corroded and rusted galvanized metal pipe with brand-new copper pipes, your house will have cleaner and better-tasting water. Repiping likewise makes sure that water pressure is higher. One thing to consider is the energy-efficiency rating of numerous water heaters. A higher score indicates better energy-efficiency and a lower operating cost. The quality of the water heater and the installation will influence the rate of your brand-new warm water heater.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and determine the reason for the problem. The line was clearly weakening; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
