Dissolved calcium and magnesium precipitate out of tough water as scale, which develops on the insides of pipes, water heaters, tea kettles, coffee machine and industrial machinery. Scale reduces circulation through pipes and is a poor conductor of heat. Ultimately, pipes can become totally clogged.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- generally 2 layers of defense. The device enables water to push the check valves open when water is coming into the building, but closes them shut when water tries to go the wrong method. There are 2 different kinds of testable backflow prevention devices that are commonly specified-- a decreased pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device. There are a couple of others that I will point out however do not get hung up on them. I discuss them only since they will be on a certification test.</p>
