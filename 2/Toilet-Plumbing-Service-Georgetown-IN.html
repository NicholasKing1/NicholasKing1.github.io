<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the very best is normal in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
