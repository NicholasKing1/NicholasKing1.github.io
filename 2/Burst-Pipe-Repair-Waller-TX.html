<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>

Nevertheless, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more.
