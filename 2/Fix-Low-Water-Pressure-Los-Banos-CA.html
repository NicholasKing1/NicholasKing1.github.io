Low Flow Toilets: While low circulation toilets are great at saving you cash on your water bills, some older designs lack the flushing power to properly eliminate waste, which leads to buildups.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
