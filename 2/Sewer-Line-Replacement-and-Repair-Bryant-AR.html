<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and intricate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. Plumbing problems aren't just tough to spot, they're also capable of triggering some major damage. Pinhole leakages, for example, are so little that they just release a couple of beads at a time. That's far too little to trigger a drop in water pressure, or any of the other symptoms that may alert of a leak in the system.
