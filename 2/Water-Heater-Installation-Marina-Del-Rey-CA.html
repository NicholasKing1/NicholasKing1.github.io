<p>Concealed water leakages are often difficult and have Possibly Serious Repercussions. Replacing your flapper might require a little different actions than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve.

You might not find an identical match, however possibilities are you'll find among the same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
<p>Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water coming from your water home appliances?
