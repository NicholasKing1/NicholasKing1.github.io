<p>Won't drain - The system might not be slicing food appropriately and waste might have clogged the drain pipe. However, if there are numerous leakages within the system, or if there is evidence of corrosion in a number of places, it is probably time to repipe. A water softener is loaded with resin beads. Difficult water with calcium and magnesium flows through this resin and, in a procedure called ion exchange, the hardness ions in the water trade places with soft ions on the resin beads. The outcome is soft water.</p>
<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it includes. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it needs to be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is usually used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
