Water pressure may fail or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
