<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is normal in our market and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market.
