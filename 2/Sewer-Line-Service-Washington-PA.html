Water pressure might stop working or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
