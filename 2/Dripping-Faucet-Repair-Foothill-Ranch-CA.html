<h3>How to Repair Kitchen Faucets in Foothill Ranch CA</h3>

But if your toilet is displaying any of the following indications, it might be time to replace it. When a water account is developed, we assess backflow requirements for services on an individual basis. After getting rid of standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain prior to you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and then flush with warm water to clear the mix.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
