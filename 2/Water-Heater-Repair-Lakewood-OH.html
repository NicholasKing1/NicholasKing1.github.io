<p>The customer has thirty days to finish installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (inspect the due date on Notification of Requirements form).

The majority of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with most disposal installations running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
