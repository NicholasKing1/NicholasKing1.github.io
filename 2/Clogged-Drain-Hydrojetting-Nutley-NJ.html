Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>

This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
