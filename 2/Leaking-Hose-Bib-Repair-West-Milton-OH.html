<p>Atmospheric vacuum breakers (AVB) are the easiest design of backflow preventer. If you have less than 6 control valves, they are the least expensive, but likewise the least reliable choice. These gadgets are not developed as a whole-system backflow prevention valve; one should be set up at every control valve.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
