<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
