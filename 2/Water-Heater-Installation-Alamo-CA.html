<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which styles are best for specific applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are defined by local statutes and environmental regulations. Local building regulations for example will need a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air space between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any prospective siphon before it can take place, preventing infecting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more sophisticated and complex backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices set up to avoid backflow range from the fairly simple to the really advanced and complex.</p>
