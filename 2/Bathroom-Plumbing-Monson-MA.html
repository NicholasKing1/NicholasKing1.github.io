<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Monson MA</h3>
<p>For the most part, the toilet can be fixed rather than replaced, considering that the concern frequently comes down to a single component or 2. In some cases, however, the damage is so extensive that you either need to replace the whole toilet, or the cost of repairs is so large that replacement is simply a more useful alternative. This normally includes fractures in the toilet bowl itself, extensive deterioration over numerous elements, or simply because you  want to replace your existing toilet with something more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
