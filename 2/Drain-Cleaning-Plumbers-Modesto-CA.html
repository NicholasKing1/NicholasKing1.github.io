<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. A response crew is available for initial investigation of sewer emergency situations every day of the year. If sewage from the City-maintained portion of the sewer system supports through sinks or toilets, call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance personnel at (503) 823-1700. City workers will examine and eliminate clogs in the mainline sewer and the part of the service line that the City is responsible for. If the problem is the result of excessive storm water in the system, you may need to wait up until the storm has subsided to have the backup solved.</p>
<p>The toilet takes an actually very long time to flush. Here's how it works: During typical operation, the pressure between the two check valves-- described as the zone of lowered pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure.

<p>When a garbage disposal breaks, it is most likely only a matter of time before your sink starts to clog, as you and other house members are most likely not used to ensuring that no obstructive food waste decreases your drain. Those dissolved solids can trigger a flaky accumulation on whatever from dishes, to pipes, to the heating elements of your appliances, to your own body. Soap residue and clogged, corroded plumbing are generally the outcome of tough water.</p>
