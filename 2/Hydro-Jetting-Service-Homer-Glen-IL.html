<p>Back-siphonage is backflow caused by a negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a Public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system.

<h3>Clogged Sewer Line in Homer Glen Illinois</h2>
<p>Sinkholes don't just occur in your backyard, sadly, when a sewer line breaks. If there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running below your house's foundation, the very best you can expect is to find out rapidly. Otherwise, as the leaky sewer line spills out below your house, a sinkhole will trigger the foundation to move and establish fractures. In this case, you'll need skilled plumbers as well as structure repair experts.</p>
