Leakages in this unit, are probably a result of a loose connection, rust, and, obstructions.</p>

<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
