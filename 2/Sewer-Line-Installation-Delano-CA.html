<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>All water softeners will include some kind of secondary tank. This is where the homeowner will need to include water softener salt. Water is added to the tank to create a salt solution called salt water. For that reason, this part is called the salt water tank. 106.8 Required Licenses: A Long Form license will be needed for all new plumbing and fuel gas work needing one or more inspections, including significant changes or additions and style retrofit work; and for any plumbing work needing the establishment of a brand-new WSSC Water client account.</p>
