<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to prevent backflow. The standard ways of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The basic system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the offender. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
