<p>Finding the location or source of a problem is done through visual inspection of sewer pipes, dye testing, and closed circuit video of the sewer main. By checking the inside of sewage systems, teams can figure out the source of the problem, nature of the clog, and condition of the pipe If you reside in Ames, IA, plumbing installation from Golden Rule Plumbing, Heating & Cooling can take care of a complete repiping quickly and successfully.</p>
<p>If you have a garbage disposal, you can attempt dumping a tray of ice cubes down the drain, and then turn on the waste disposal unit while running water. This will knock off any food particles stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it too. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or tired, worn sink? No issue is too great for our extremely trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our experienced plumbing group does the job rapidly and cost effectively.</p>
<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Homes that were built prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how helpful, is an ecological contaminant (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in houses that is not lead based). You may not desire to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest double flush HET provided by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We suggest, as the majority of plumbers do, to use disposals moderately. Appropriate care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
