<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts should be gotten rid of and changed with new rubber parts. It is important that only original factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to utilize and changing the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, enabling air to restore and get in the valve pressure equivalent to ambient climatic standard. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
