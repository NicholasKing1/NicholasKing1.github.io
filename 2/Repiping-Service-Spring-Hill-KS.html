<p>You may be dealing with frequent plumbing issues if you're living in an old home that's never been renovated.

<p>Prevention is better than remedy. If you have a well or an irrigation system, you need to install a backflow device on your water system. Discolored water- Your water needs to always be crystal clear. Discolored water suggests rust in your pipes or hot water heater. If your water is an uncommon color, this warrants professional attention. New gas line setups are done for new appliances like burners, ranges, outdoor lighting, and grills.
