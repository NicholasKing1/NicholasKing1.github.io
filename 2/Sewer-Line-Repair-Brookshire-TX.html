<p>Water solidity is the quantity of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Due to the fact that soap reacts with the calcium to form soap scum, the factor you can feel the difference on your skin is. This results in the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. Which's where the term hardness" originated from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may need to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug package that I bought separately from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Some of the reasons for drain line blockages in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a failing garbage disposal, or excessive food being gotten rid of down the drain. We will typically suggest our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending upon the seriousness of the scenario. Provide us a call if your kitchen drain has actually raised water levels, is making gurgling noises, smells foul, or is sluggish to drain.</p>
