<p>The amount of hot water you utilize every day and whether your existing water heater is able to fulfill that demand. This quantity is usually based upon the number of people in your home. The immediate advantage to this transcends accessibility for houses and places with higher requirements. While an electric heater might serve for smaller households, the gas heater might be a much better choice for matching needs.</p>
<p>When pressure in a water system exceeds the pressure in the safe and clean system supplying the make-up water, backpressure is created. This can require the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Possible impurities can then go into the drinkable water system. The best method to minimize build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially difficult with high mineral material, you may need to flush the hot water heater more frequently.</p>
<p>Other signs you might need to repipe include rust in your water system, low water pressure, and damp areas in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these are common signs that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily indicate repiping is the only service. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will take a look at the problem to determine the very best course of action.</p>
