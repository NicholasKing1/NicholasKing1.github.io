<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a significant clog that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
