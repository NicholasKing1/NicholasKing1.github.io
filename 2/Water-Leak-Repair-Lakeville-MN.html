<p>After getting here after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but claimed they wouldn't take responsibility if it leaked now because of some undefined oddities in how my sink was assembled. After they offered me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, because I never wish to see this company again.</p>
