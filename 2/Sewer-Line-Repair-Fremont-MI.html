<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is adversely charged and has space to hold on to positive ions. The fresh media begins by hanging on to the weaker charged sodium ions. As difficult water travels through your water softener tank, the stronger charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Since the firmness minerals have a greater positive charge than the sodium, they will knock the salt ions off and take their place.</p>
