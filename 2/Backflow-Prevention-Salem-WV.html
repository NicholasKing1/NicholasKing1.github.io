<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually often been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening simply removes hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>

Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Safe and clean and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system if these connections are not properly secured.</p>
