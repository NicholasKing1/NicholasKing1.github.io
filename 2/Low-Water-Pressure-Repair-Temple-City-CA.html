<p>Reach for a typical household plunger if these combinations aren't effective in unclogging your sink. If you have a double sink, first seal off the 2nd side with a wet cloth or a stopper. You'll need to create a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you plan to plunge with sufficient water to cover the bell of the plunger. Location the plunger firmly over the drain and plunge intensely several times. Get rid of the plunger and flush the drain well with warm water when you hear the suction clear the clog.</p>
<p>Blending vaporized salt with rock salt is not suggested, as this might clog the softening reservoir. It is recommended that you allow your system to go empty of one type of salt prior to adding another to prevent the occurrence of any problems. In any case, when you're preparing a water heater replacement, play it safe. Call your local department of inspections and ask if you need a license. And ensure a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
