<p>A water softener works by using electrical charges to eliminate the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and numerous other minerals bring favorable charges, so water softeners use sodium ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions.

If you have two meters, safe and clean and irrigation, you are also needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber Ashland VA</h3>
<p>Hard water can damage havoc on your home's plumbing and devices by triggering scale buildup in your pipes, obstructing them and the aerators. As soon as this occurs it will cause a decline in the water pressure and also drastically decreases the life expectancy of all household devices. Water leaks: If you see a leak in your pipes, there may be other leakages you are unaware of. Leakages are a sure indication that your pipes are old and used and need to be changed. Rather than needing to constantly repair them, the best option. is to replace them.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>

<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has actually typically been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening simply gets rid of hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a threat to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers personal preference not need. However, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
