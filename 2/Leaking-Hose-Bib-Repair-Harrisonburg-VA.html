<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has actually typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening merely removes firmness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not need. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
