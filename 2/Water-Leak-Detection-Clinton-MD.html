<p>Since the copper pipes have not had a chance to end up being coated inside, New homes developed with copper pipes are particularly prone to destructive water conditions. As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a period of three to five months after occupancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Numerous brand-new homes are built with PEX and not copper.</p>
