Broken Pipes: Pipes are cracked, pierced or collapsed by shifting soil, frozen ground, settling, etc</p>
<p>Prior to selection and installation, describe makers literature for temperature ranges. All assemblies must be safeguarded from freezing temperatures and if set up where temperature levels will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly must be used.
