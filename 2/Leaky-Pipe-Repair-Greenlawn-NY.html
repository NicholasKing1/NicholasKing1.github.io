Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close.
