<p>Relatively new technology has actually brought about tankless hot water heater. Rather than, holding a set quantity of hot water, it heats it on an on-demand basis. It enables significant energy savings and an endless supply of warm water. Adios cold showers! We install, repair and service all brand names available at rates our competitors can't touch.</p>
<p>Lots of bad things are being stated on this article about liners. I find that lots of old time plumbers are not informed on liners and have no hint on what they are stating.
