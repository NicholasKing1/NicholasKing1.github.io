<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal preference. A permit is not needed for repairs which involve only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions provided alterations are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A normal water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, large salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a neighboring drain or drywell.</p>
