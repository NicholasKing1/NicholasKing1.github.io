<p>The most typical bathroom sink plumbing problem homeowners deal with is a clogged drain, from the build-up of hair, soap scum, and even foreign items like bobby pins or cotton bud. If you have a clogged sink in your bathroom, you can try to unclog it the sink yourself using a sink plunger.

<p>Pull the two lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the harmed fuel lines. A small cylindrical fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank when you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer.

<p>If you turn on your home's water spigots and water begins flowing out with a yellowish, reddish or brownish tint, that's a clear indication that rust or sediment has developed in your pipes and a repiping task must be in your future.
