The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if required, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. This implies the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
