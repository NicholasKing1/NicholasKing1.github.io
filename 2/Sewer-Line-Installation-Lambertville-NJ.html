<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. The majority of house centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>

Sanford & Kid plumbing provides sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas. During regrowth, salted water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>Once the brand-new unit is firmly installed under the sink, it's time to hook up the plumbing, a procedure that's largely the very same whatever mount is used. The specifics - where you begin, how much you cut, and how it's all set up - are special to each installation.
