<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber Citrus Heights CA</h3>
<p>We genuinely appreciate our customers and the services that we supply. As difficult water goes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade locations with sodium ions (Figure 1). Salt ions are held loosely and are changed quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. During this process, totally free" salt ions are launched into the water. The time in between recharging cycles depends upon the hardness of the water, the quantity of water utilized, the size of the system and the capacity of the exchange media to remove firmness.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
