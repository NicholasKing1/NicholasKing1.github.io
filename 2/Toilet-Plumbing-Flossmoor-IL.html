<p>When the end user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water flows in the typical direction from the provider, downstream to fill the user's need. The flow of water pushes the spring-loaded check valves open. The stress of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure difference in the Zone of Minimized Pressure. This distinction in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water flows in the regular instructions.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our market and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can attain this.</p>
