<p>The majority of softeners have a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to provide some type of maintenance to it or even while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you select does not have a bypass, then it's wise to develop one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to keep the system.</p>
<p>At the top of the old disposer, put the wrenchette or a screwdriver" into the right side of among the lugs in the installing ring. While holding the bottom of the disposal with the other hand, turn the mounting ring counterclockwise to launch the disposal.
