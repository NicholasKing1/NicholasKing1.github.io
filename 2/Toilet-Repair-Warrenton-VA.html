<p>We had a fantastic experience with Joe Boyette, he was really professional, courteous, skilled. We had a great deal of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month duration. We also had to replace a water and a bathroom heater unrelated to the fire, however we felt confident in Joe's abilities. We made the decision to stick with Joe, despite the fact that we felt Mr Rooter costs were absolutely on the high-end. This being published by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange.

When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
