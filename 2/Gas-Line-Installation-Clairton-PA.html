<p>The program accomplishes its mission by attending to the adoption and promulgation of suitable rules and regulations for the construction of plumbing centers where mandated.

<p>In many cases, our specialists will suggest that you replace your hot water heater rather than purchase repairs. This is normally When the water heater is more than 10 years old or the cost of repairs would amount to more than half the cost of an entire brand-new system, the case. In some cases a bothersome toilet simply requires a small adjustment and life is back to regular. That is why we provide a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) change the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) perform a color test.</p>
