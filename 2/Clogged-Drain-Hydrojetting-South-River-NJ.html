<p>IRWD is dedicated to delivering safe, high quality water to customers. Our comprehensive water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water delivered to our consumers is kept free from harmful impurities. A fundamental part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to equipment including a nonpotable substance, this is known as a cross-connection. Contamination may happen when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or cooling and heating system, into the drinkable water system. This can happen through a process known as backflow.</p>
<p>Water hardness is the quantity of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the difference on your skin is since soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. Which's where the term hardness" came from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>
