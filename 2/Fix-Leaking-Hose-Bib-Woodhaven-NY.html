<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mainly time related. If everything is all set, in good condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be customized, replaced, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours required and therefore the total costs. A lot of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal installations running $50 per hour for three hours total, making the labor expenses roughly $150.</p>
<p>When looking for a brand-new flapper, your best choice is to try and find the same flapper that initially featured your existing flush valve. The most convenient way to do that is by searching for your toilet design and choosing the flapper advised for that design.
