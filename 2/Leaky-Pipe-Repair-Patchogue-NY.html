<p>The majority of homes or structures that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition protection. As the outer finish of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
