<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Bronxville NY</h3>
<p>Corrosion is a complex phenomenon and there are numerous elements that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and property plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that accelerate corrosion Likewise, there is an absence of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of deterioration control. Thus, considering all these aspects, along with results from research study studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
