<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you've been advised by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is normal in our market and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively working together that you can achieve this.</p>
