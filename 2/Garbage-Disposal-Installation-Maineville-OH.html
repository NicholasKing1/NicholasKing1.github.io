<p>The Bureau of Plumbing and Gasfitting Inspections is a division of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections and is responsible for inspecting work carried out by licensed plumbers and gasfitters to ensure conformity with the plumbing and gas code. Bill 41-15 (PDF): The Existing Plumbing and Gasfitting Code of Baltimore County was authorized by the County Council on May 4, 2015 with a reliable date of July 1, 2015. This code embraced the PHCC National Requirement Plumbing Code - Illustrated, 2015 edition, the NFPA 54 National Fuel Gas Code, 2015 edition and the NFPA 58 Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code, 2014 edition.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, enabling air to enter the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
