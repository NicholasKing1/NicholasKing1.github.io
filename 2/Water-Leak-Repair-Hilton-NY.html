<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to remove the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and numerous other minerals bring favorable charges, so water softeners utilize salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with drinkable water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, safe and clean and irrigation, you are also required to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

Set a container under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
