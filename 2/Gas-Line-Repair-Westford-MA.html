<h3>Blocked Drains in Westford Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Place the flange on the top side of the sink, and connect the attachment system on the underside (Image 1). It is helpful to use pressure on the flange from above using a 2nd set of hands or a heavy object. This will keep the flange in location while connecting the fastening system below. Ensure the plumber's putty is noticeably oozing beyond the edge of the flange all around (Image 2). When a complete seal has formed, get rid of the excess putty with a rag.</p>

<p>If you 'd like to get rid of the salt, just fill the salt water tank with potassium chloride pellets, not salt pellets.

A hydro jetter is a pump-and-hose system that uses high-powered water jets to clear residential and commercial drain pipes. Many high-pressure water jetters will operate with approximately 4,000 PSI of pressure and will push anywhere from 2-18 gallons of water per minute through a pipe.</p>

<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
