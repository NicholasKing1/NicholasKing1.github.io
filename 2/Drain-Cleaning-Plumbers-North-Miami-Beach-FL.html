<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so just softened water passes through to your house. Once the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is usually used in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>
