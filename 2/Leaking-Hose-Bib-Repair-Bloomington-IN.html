Floor Drains: Those discovered in basements, laundry patio areas, rooms, or garages and driveways are made with a trap that ought to be kept filled with water to prevent smells and sewer gas from leaving.</p>

This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove debris such as difficult water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
