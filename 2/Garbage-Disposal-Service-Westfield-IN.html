<p>Wood pipes were used in London and elsewhere during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely utilized in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
