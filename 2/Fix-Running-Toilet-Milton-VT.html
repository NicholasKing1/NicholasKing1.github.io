As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite an annoyance-- for its numerous intended uses around your home.</p>
<p>While many water heater problems can be effectively repaired, some problems will require complete hot water heater replacement.
