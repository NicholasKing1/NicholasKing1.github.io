<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
