When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to push the waste out of your drain system. Current regulations restrict the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles piling up in cast iron drain lines. We offer 2 types of water treatment systems for hard water: Advantage Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
