Owners and boards of buildings that are provided an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer should file plans with the DEP within 1 month. If the DEP has actually not received accreditation from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being set up within that time, a Notification of Infraction will be sent out. Violators will be responsible for a civil charge of up to $1,000 provided by the Environmental Control Board (ECB).
