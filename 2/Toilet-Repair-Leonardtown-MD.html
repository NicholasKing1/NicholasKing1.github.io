<p>. Backflow into a public water system can contaminate the water or pollute in that system (i.e., backflow into a public water supply can make the water in that system hazardous or unusable to drink), and each water supplier has a responsibility to provide water that is usable and safe to consume under all foreseeable scenarios. Additionally, customers usually have outright faith that water delivered to them through a public water system is always safe to drink. For these reasons, your water district should take safety measures to secure its public water supply against backflow.</p>
