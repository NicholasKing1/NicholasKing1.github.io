Today, the majority of quality contractors use PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers should just be repaired when the information collected from the field test suggests the assembly has actually broken down in its performance below the established minimum basic. The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer need to be repaired or if required, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
