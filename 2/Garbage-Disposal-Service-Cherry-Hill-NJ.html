<p>Action 6: To connect the drain, place the gasket in the discharge outlet. Then attach the discharge tube with the flange and bolts. Now hang the disposal by lining up the 3 tabs with the mounting ring. Use the included wrench to turn and lock the tabs over the ridges. Then connect the dishwasher drain. Ensure the discharge pipe is lined up properly and connect your drains-- utilize a T-pipe before your P-trap.</p>
