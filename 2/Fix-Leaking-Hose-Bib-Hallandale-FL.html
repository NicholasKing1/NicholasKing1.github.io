As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather an annoyance-- for its lots of desired usages around your house.</p>
