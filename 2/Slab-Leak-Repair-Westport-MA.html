This can be corrected by just resetting your water softener to get rid of less solidity or to run longer between regrowth cycles.</p>

<p>Clark's Process: This procedure is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which triggers the solidity ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 need to be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down.
