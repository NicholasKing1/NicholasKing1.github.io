<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you've been advised by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can position problems.</p>
