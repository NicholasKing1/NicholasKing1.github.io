<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps catch moisture and sediment so that they do not go into the control unit. Unlike a drip leg, the flow of the gas is altered to remove any sediment. A sediment trap might be included in a drip leg install. The City requires backflow prevention gadgets to be set up anywhere there exists a connection that could allow tainted water into the City system or private plumbing. These devices undergo testing by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. Oftentimes, they undergo periodic tests later on, as well.</p>
