<p>The toilet takes an actually very long time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout typical operation, the pressure between the two check valves-- referred to as the zone of minimized pressure-- is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is developed to release and open water to the outside, guaranteeing backflow never takes place.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the structure; extra, more substantial costs can happen if the drop in water pressure ends up being a concern for residents. A PE or RA can help identify if setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>
