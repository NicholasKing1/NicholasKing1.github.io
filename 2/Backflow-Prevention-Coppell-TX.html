<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal preference. An authorization is not required for repairs which involve only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided modifications are not made in the existing piping or fixtures.

A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a nearby drain or drywell.</p>
<p>If you discover an odor or undesirable odor originating from your system, which is not unusual, consider purchasing a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where nasty smells can leave.
