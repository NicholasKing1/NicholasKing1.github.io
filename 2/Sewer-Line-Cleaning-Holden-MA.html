<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent person. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and provided as assured. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be higher.</p>
<p>It clashes with the decoration. If you're one of the lucky owners of an avocado green or coral pink toilet from years past, treat yourself to a toilet replacement.

This is due mainly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment.

The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers personal preference not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
