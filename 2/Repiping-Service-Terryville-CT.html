An RPBA is effective versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and may be utilized to separate health or non-health hazards.</p>
<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which styles are best for particular applications? Typically the type and installation requirements are spelled out by environmental guidelines and local statutes. Local building codes for instance will require a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air space between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any possible siphon prior to it can take place, preventing polluting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more complex and sophisticated backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical gadgets installed to prevent backflow variety from the fairly basic to the extremely sophisticated and complex.</p>
