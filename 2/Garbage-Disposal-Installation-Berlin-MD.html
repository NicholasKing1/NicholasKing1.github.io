These correspond directly to just how much waste the system can manage, and suggested sizes are generally based upon how many users are in a household.

<p>Some makers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, but how do they work and which designs are best for particular applications?
