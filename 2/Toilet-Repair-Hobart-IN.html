If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should likewise be installed at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local authorities, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some towns do not enable the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can only secure against back siphonage.</p>
