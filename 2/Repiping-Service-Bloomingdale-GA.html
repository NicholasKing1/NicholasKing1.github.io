<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>

Then that generally suggests that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience clogs in several drains at when in your home. This can happen in multiple locations and any combination of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine.
