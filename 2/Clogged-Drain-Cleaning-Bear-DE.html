<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the level of the rot.

Before you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
