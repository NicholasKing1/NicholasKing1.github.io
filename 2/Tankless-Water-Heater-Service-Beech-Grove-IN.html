<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
