Many people dispose food waste in the garbage, which indicates more garbage to enter garbage dumps or be incinerated.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the cause of the issue. The line was plainly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
