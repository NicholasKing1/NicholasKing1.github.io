<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â² hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
