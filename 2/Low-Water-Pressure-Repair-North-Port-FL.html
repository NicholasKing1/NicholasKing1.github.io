<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of significant surgical treatment, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it just implies old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes.

You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing major and regular leaks. If you do have regular leakages, we find that repiping can really be the cheaper and much better long-lasting option.</p>
