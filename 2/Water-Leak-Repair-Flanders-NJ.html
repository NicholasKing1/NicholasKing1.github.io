<p>When, the gas pipe turns up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, but must then shift to galvanized. I am uncertain why that should be. It is also allowed to use black iron if it is most likely covered with a galvanized finishing (which is basically a special paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E typically does this.</p>
<p>Hard water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water goes through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is normally utilized in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start again.</p>

Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections.
