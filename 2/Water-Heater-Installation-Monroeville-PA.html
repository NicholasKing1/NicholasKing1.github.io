Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow.

<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps record moisture and sediment so that they do not go into the control unit. Unlike a drip leg, the circulation of the gas is altered to remove any sediment. A sediment trap may be included in a drip leg install.
