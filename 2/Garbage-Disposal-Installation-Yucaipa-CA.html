<h3>Hiring The Services Of A Professional Plumbing Service Provider Yucaipa CA</h3>
<p>The most effective way to resolve tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
