<p>When deciding on the proper system defense there are several considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all situations in the cross-connection world.

The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of sprinkler systems consists of the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire security system are developed to match the hazard that exists in the locations they are set up in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be really various, we need to comprehend that the fire security system for any installation requires to be created and set up to satisfy that particular hazard or need. An aircraft hangar will need an extremely different fire security system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow protection requirements for these two examples would also vary significantly.</p>
