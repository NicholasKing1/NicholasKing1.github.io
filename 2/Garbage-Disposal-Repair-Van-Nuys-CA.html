<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. A reaction crew is readily available for preliminary investigation of sewer emergencies every day of the year. Call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance personnel at (503) 823-1700 if sewage from the City-maintained part of the sewer system backs up through toilets or sinks. City workers will check and remove obstructions in the mainline sewer and the part of the service line that the City is responsible for. If the issue is the outcome of too much storm water in the system, you might need to wait till the storm has diminished to have actually the backup dealt with.</p>
<p>Discharge piping linked to a storm sewer shall be geared up with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for instance, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices recommends a DCV assembly on dry or wet sprinkler systems unless there is a danger of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
<p>For non-emergency toilet replacement or other needs, please call us or utilize the practical email kind below. We'll get back in touch soon. There is a cost differential. Trenchless repair will typically be about half the cost of traditional work. This is why it is essential to have an expert plumbing service on hand to figure out which solution is best.</p>
<p>If there's an existing disposal, utilize the helpful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. A number of homes in my area being repiped and have spoken with neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Obviously it starts with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can trigger major damage if the leak isn't spotted soon.</p>
