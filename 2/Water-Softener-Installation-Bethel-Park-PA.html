<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and elsewhere throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
