<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Livingston TX</h3>
<p>We are an insured and licensed drain cleaning contractor who can clear out difficult drain blockages and leave them working fresh once again. The typical cost to install a gas line for a kitchen stove is $15 to $25 per direct foot. Total expenses range from $200 to $1,000 or more depending on the length of piping required to link to the main gas supply, which normally averages 30'.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers bring only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
