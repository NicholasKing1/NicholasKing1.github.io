<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health hazard if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, along with inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
