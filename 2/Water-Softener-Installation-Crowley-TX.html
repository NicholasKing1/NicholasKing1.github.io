<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to service? The timing of regeneration depends upon the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, regardless of whether the water really requires it. Newer systems use digital sensing units that keep track of bead depletion and other essential metrics based on your water use and therefore just regenerate when required. These more recent systems, likewise described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect due to the fact that they conserve energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>

This system uses a vacuum-assisted flushing system to suck the water into the bowl and down into the sewage systems. A disadvantage of this device is that it's much more challenging to unblock your toilet were to become clogged.</p>
