<p>You may be dealing with frequent plumbing concerns if you're living in an old home that's never ever been renovated. Even if you do not have significant problems, it's smart to repipe your home to safeguard your residential or commercial property and avoid more substantial concerns in the future. Here are signs saying you need a repipe company.</p>
<p>Most homes or structures that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition protection. As the external covering of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Water on the Floor or Discoloration of Flooring - If your feet get damp when you flush, that's not a feature ... it's a problem! It could mean a leak under the toilet if your linoleum floor is getting dark around the toilet. Tough water is typically not damaging to one's health but can present severe plumbing problems in both residential and commercial applications. From the absence of suds formation in bathing and laundry applications to the expensive breakdowns in boilers, cooling towers and other devices that deal with water, water hardness is a major problem.</p>
