<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to overstated advertising and, in part, to customer misconceptions about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening just gets rid of hardness minerals and removes problems that are a nuisance and not a threat to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and drawbacks, that make this decision a considerable one.</p>
