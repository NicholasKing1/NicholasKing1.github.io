Turn on the gas and check connections for leakages by brushing a 50-50 mix of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mixture bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten up or reconnect joints that leak. Clean the joints dry when ended up. Call the plumbing inspector to check out your work. Follow the how-to guidance that accompanies the pictures to make certain the connections are tight.</p>
<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the splendor in the toilet world, however the trip lever is the bridge in between guy and machine. After all, if the trip lever doesn't raise the flapper to flush the toilet, you need to wiggle and jerk and often even stick your hand in there and lift the flapper by hand. And who wishes to do all that work??? In all seriousness though, making sure your trip lever is working well can save you the hassle of those small daily hassles - that most people simply deal with and never understand they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to discuss the gallons of water lost every day by a poor seal.</p>
