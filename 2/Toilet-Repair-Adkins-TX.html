Here's everything you need to know before rolling up your sleeves, straight from the pros.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- normally salt.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
