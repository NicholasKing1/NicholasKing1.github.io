<h3>How To Install A Sand Trap Drain Daytona Beach FL</h3>

<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
