<h3>Install Water Heater in University Place Washington</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least 3 efforts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his understanding and experience he figured out that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris decreased the newly cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and persistence the task was done to my complete satisfaction.</p>
