<p>If you choose to attempt this task yourself, be prepared to keep precise track of about a dozen tiny parts (put the stopper in the sink so none of them drop the drain). There are several faucet designs, so you may not have the ability to inform what to replace up until you have actually done the disassembly. Whether you do it yourself or employ a plumber, this would be a good time to consider whether you wish to upgrade the faucet with a brand-new design.</p>
