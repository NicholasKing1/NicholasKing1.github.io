<p>When you get rid of the cap to eliminate the valve, examine the washer for wear or cracks. Changing a bad washer is easy and cheap. However finding the ideal washer might not be. The most common washers are typically available in the house centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be hard to discover. If you decide to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the store to discover a match. Plumbers generally replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>Then lay a towel in the sink and set the disposal on the flange to keep it from moving. Registered contractors are needed to tape-record backflow test result through the Backflow Prevention Assembly Testing and Inventory application within 15 days of test.
