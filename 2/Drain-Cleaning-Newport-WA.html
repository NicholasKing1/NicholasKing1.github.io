<h3>Know The Work Of The Commercial Plumber Newport WA</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
