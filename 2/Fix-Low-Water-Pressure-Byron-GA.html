<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of significant surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing major and regular leaks. If you do have frequent leaks, we find that repiping can in fact be the less expensive and much better long-term solution.</p>
<p>The drains in the typical house get constant usage. Hair, food scraps, soap scum, and other debris can gradually build up in time. The drain will slowly slow up until it ends up being entirely clogged. Chemical drain cleaners sold in shops have limited effectiveness. Although the drain may appear to clear initially, the result is often temporary and the clog quickly returns. Using these chemicals frequently can trigger damage to your plumbing pipes.</p>
