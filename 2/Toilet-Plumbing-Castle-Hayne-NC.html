<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Castle Hayne NC</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system needs to be constantly monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
