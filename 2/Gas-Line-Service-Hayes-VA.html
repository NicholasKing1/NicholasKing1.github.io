Consumer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get an estimate from private plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of the businesses we called would provide a quote over the phone. All of them wished to look at the situation before devoting to a price, and all wished to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks found only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
