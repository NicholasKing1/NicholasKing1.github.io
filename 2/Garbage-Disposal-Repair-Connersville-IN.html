Contamination may take place when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating & cooling system, into the potable water supply. This can take place through a procedure known as backflow.</p>

Some models may seem similar on the outdoors however might need different repair parts on the inside, so the repair service technician need to have the ability to identify the make, design and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that might have been produced. Sometimes the identification number of the assembly will be needed to separate one model from another. It is essential to know the proper design to ensure you get the right repair parts.</p>

At the least, it would have been a very costly choice.</p>
