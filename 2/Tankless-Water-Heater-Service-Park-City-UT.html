<p>Leaks can occur if the seal between the tank and bowl fails, or the seal at the floor drain stops working.

Harmed toilets can do some genuinely substantial, costly, and ... stinky damage to a home.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and determine the reason for the problem. The line was plainly deteriorating; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
