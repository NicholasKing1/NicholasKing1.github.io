<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Willowbrook IL</h3>
<p>In most cases, the toilet can be fixed rather than changed, because the concern typically boils down to a single component or more. In some cases, however, the damage is so substantial that you either need to replace the entire toilet, or the cost of repairs is so big that replacement is simply a more practical option. This generally involves fractures in the toilet bowl itself, extensive deterioration over several components, or just because you  want to replace your existing toilet with something more visually pleasing.</p>
