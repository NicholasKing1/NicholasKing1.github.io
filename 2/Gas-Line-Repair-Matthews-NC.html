<p>Rust is an intricate phenomenon and there are numerous elements that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and property plumbing. For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that accelerate corrosion Likewise, there is an absence of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of deterioration control. Thus, considering all these factors, in addition to results from research study studies, WQA's position is that a correctly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer.

The line was clearly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
