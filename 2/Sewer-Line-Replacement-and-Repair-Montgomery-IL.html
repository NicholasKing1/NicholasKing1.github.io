<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
