<p>Many cars and trucks have a metal line that runs the length of the vehicle with rubber fuel lines linking at either end, one at the fuel tank and the other to the engine. Fixing a leaking fuel line is a simple task for a repair facility and costs in between $60 and $120. Lavacot states it can quickly be done at home by the semi-advanced mechanic. Difficult water causes gray or white deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be used to decrease these signs.</p>
<p>New houses built with copper pipes are specifically susceptible to corrosive water conditions because the copper pipes have not had a chance to become coated within. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new home for a period of three to five months after tenancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Numerous new houses are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>
