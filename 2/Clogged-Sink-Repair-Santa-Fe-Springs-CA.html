<p>Water softeners leaks are mostly caused since of a concern at the point of installation or since of maintenance. When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. If the bypass valve is cracked, it can likewise trigger the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or replaced in time. A broken rotor valve or rotor valve seal may likewise be the offender. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regeneration processes.
