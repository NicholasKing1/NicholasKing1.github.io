<p>Woodbury, in addition to lots of other communities and organizations, has actually discovered the best method to avoid these discolorations from happening is by decreasing the variety of times your water softener regrows. "Restoring" describes the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "exhausted" or complete. However, lots of water softeners regrow too often, when the filter medium really isn't full. This can be remedied by just resetting your water softener to eliminate less hardness or to run longer in between regeneration cycles.</p>
