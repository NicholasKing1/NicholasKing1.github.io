Dealing with gas is really hazardous, and it is important to shut off the line to allow for a safe repair procedure.</p>
<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will ultimately take its toll. If you see that your plumbing experiences numerous clogs, leakages, and water pressure change that no amount of repairs seems to stem, you must consult a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as a solution.

<p>Most houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather protection. As the outer finish of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>

Under the provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1971, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established national requirements for safe drinking water.
