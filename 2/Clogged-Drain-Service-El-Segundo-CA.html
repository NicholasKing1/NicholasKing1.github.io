<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>

<p>The toilet takes a really long period of time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout typical operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves-- referred to as the zone of lowered pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is developed to open and release water to the outside, guaranteeing backflow never takes place.</p>
