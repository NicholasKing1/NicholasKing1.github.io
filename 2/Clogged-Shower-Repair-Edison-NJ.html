<p>Regular leakages: Leaks originating from your hot water heater are never a great sign. It is likely more affordable to replace the entire unit if your water heater has frequent leakages or is constantly needing repairs. A backflow preventer is a device that's installed on your house's pipes that allows water to flow in one direction but never ever in the opposite direction. Its sole job is to prevent drinking water from being polluted due to backflow.</p>
<p>Repiping is not a temporary fix. It's an irreversible option for the whole plumbing system in your home or company. We switch off the water system, eliminate old pipe and replace it with new pipe. After the brand-new system is installed, we turn the water on and perform tests on the new system. Once the system passes our tests, it's excellent to go for you.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and figure out the cause of the problem. The line was plainly degrading; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
