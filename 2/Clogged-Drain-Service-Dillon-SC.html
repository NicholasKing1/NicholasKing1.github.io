<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to prevent backflow. The basic means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The basic mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
<p>A minimum of when every 3 months, drain water from the tank. Gradually sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct efficiency, and draining a gallon or so helps eliminate the sediment. If you identify a leak and go with a patching task rather of a repiping task, simply remember that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the exact same material and they may be next. To prevent further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to consider repiping your entire home when you identify a leak.</p>
