<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Lexington SC</h3>

When water enters your home from the main water supply line, it needs to just ever flow in one direction: into your house.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air.

This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
