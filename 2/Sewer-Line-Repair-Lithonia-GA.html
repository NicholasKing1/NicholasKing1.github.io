It is essential that only original factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts.

<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
