<p>In this circumstance, unclean water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Worms for irrigation systems: Citizens found parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the air pressure breaker malfunctioned on an independently owned underground sprinkler system. During a water pressure drop, the vacuum in the system sucked some water from the sprinkler into the city water. The house owner found worms swimming in the bathtub while filling it to bathe his kid.</p>
<p>You want to save water. Older toilets use up to 7 gallons of water per flush and are much less water-efficient than more recent models.
