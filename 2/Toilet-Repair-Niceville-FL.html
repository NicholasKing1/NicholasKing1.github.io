<p>We had roots through our sewer line so it was regularly clogging. They came out and dug a new route for the line connected it to the sewer and whatever.

<p>As discussed previously in the post, carbon monoxide is colorless and entirely odorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every house should have carbon monoxide gas detectors set up at the proper areas. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family residences to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are usually offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new installations need to have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
<p>There are a couple of dead giveaways that will let you know you have a gas line leak in your home, and it is very important to take notice of them. The gas pipe may be punctured or damaged if you observe a strong smell that looks like rotten eggs. You may also hear a hissing sound as the gas is leaving from the line, but that isn't always the case. If you smell rotten eggs, it is essential to take action rapidly to avoid any major problems and to keep everyone safe.</p>
<p>No homeowner wishes to handle inefficient plumbing, especially when it can cost thousands in repairs. Your houses plumbing goes beyond just the pipes inside your house to the main sewer line that links to them. Most major plumbing problems normally take place on the main line, and it's best to prevent them as much as possible. Harmed sewer lines can result in bathrooms flooded with sewage, damaged pipes, and costly repairs.</p>
