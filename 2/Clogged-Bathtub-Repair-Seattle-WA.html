<p>The most efficient way to address hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.

<p>Backflow preventers must only be repaired when the information gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has actually deteriorated in its efficiency listed below the established minimum basic. The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer.

These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
