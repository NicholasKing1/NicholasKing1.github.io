<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most disastrous and widespread water problems: difficult water.  Difficult water ruined the modern-day home. Scale develops in your pipes, obstructing them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale significantly shortens the life-span of devices like dishwashers, coffee makers and ice devices.

<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Newbury Park CA!</h3>
<p>Polybutylene utilized inside your house can be discovered near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets. Caution: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Because copper is showing does not mean you do not have polybutylene pipes, just. You may need to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers carry only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>At the top of the old disposer, put the wrenchette or a screwdriver" into the ideal side of one of the lugs in the mounting ring. While holding the bottom of the disposal with the other hand, turn the mounting ring counterclockwise to release the disposal. Understand that the disposal may include water and food waste, so carry it outside right-side up.</p>
<p>Although these house owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline prior to the problem worsened. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a really costly choice.</p>
