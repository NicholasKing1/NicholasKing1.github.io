<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it includes. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be restored (cleaned up). Salt is typically used in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
