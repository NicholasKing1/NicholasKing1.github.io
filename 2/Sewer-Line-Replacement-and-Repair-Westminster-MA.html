We see this a lot on standard electrical water heaters, which use a pair of electric heating elements to heat the tank. Frequently, one of the two burns out, resulting in water that's warm but not hot. We can replace it or detect the true problem if this isn't it.</p>

Make certain you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
