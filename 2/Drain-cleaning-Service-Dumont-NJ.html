<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service at Dumont NJ?</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system should be constantly kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Continue reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>

Lead, as you know, no matter how beneficial, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have children, you may not want to live in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
