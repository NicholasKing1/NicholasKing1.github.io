<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
