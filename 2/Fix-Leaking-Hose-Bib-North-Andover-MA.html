Salt is normally utilized in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>

<p>Corrosion is a complex phenomenon and there are numerous aspects that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that speed up rust Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of deterioration control.
