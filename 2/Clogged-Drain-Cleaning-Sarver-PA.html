<p>Discharge piping connected to a storm sewer shall be geared up with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices suggests a DCV assembly on damp or dry lawn sprinkler unless there is a danger of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
<p>When pressure in a water system exceeds the pressure in the potable system supplying the make-up water, backpressure is produced. This can require the potable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the two systems.

In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially tough with high mineral material, you might need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>
