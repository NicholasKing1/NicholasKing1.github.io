<p>Inspect the washer for wear or cracks when you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is easy and low-cost. But finding the best washer may not be. The most common washers are often available at home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be tough to find. Eliminate it and take it to the store to discover a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
