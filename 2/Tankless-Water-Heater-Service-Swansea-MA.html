Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can lead to leakages.

<p>Rust is a complicated phenomenon and there are numerous factors that accelerate deterioration in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that accelerate rust Also, there is an absence of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of corrosion control.
