Fire defense system are created to match the risk that exists in the locations they are installed in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be very various, we need to understand that the fire security system for any installation needs to be developed and installed to meet that specific threat or need. An aircraft garage will need a very different fire defense system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow security requirements for these two examples would also vary greatly.</p>
