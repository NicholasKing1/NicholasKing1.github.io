Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly.

<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Taunton MA</h3>
<p>Rust is a complicated phenomenon and there are many aspects that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that speed up rust Likewise, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of deterioration control. Thus, considering all these factors, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
