<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Phelan CA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
