<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits.

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow direction within a piping system that is caused by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>The space under your kitchen sink has gotten more congested over the years. Initially, there would have been a hot and cold  water line going up to the faucet (normally with shut-off valves for each) and a single drain pipe with a curved trap.
