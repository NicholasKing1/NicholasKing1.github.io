<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Nesconset NY</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system must be continuously kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
