<p>In this circumstance, dirty water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Worms for watering systems: Homeowners found parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the air pressure breaker malfunctioned on an independently owned underground sprinkler system.

<p>Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.
