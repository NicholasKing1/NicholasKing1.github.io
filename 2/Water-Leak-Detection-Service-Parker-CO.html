<p>A malfunctioning garbage disposal, grease accumulation, collected food and more can all contribute to a clogged kitchen sink. The sink is the focal point in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will trigger problems.

For the more severe clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Roto-Rooter plumber.</p>
