Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly working together that you can achieve this.</p>
