<p>A water softener works by using electrical charges to eliminate the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and numerous other minerals carry favorable charges, so water softeners use sodium ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with safe and clean water, you are needed to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, safe and clean and watering, you are also required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

<p>A new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the within used thin pipe and the painting the within the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Often during the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes.

Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be properly re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
