<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The climatic vacuum breaker is among the least pricey backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage just for non-health hazard or health threat conditions. They must be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can only safeguard versus back siphonage.</p>
