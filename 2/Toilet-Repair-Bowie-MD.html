<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct effect on your safety, benefit, comfort, and dependability than your plumbing system. This is exceptionally important! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to press the waste out of your drain system. Current guidelines restrict the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines.
