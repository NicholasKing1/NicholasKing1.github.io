<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>Some producers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
