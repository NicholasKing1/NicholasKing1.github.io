Water pressure might be or fail reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
