<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the required instructions of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. If enabled to return to the water supply, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for efficiency, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
