<p>Many disposals will last in between 10 and 12 years prior to requiring replacement. Signs that your disposal needs to be changed consist of requiring to press the reset button regularly, the blades no longer slicing up the waste well or taking longer to slice up the waste, leaking from the bottom of the unit, frequent obstructions, or noticeable deterioration on the system itself.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
