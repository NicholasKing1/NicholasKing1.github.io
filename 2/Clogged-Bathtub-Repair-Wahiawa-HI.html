Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
