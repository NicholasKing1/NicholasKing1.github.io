<p>Both irrigation water and clean water supply are at high threat of coming into contact with pollutants due to backflows. Numerous faucets can have a low-flow aerator set up at the outlet end of the water spout.

Adding air in this way keeps constant water pressure, which causes the fixture to utilize less water.</p>
