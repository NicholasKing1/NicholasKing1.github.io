With our professional garbage disposal replacement and installation services, you can be confident that you're all set for many years of reliable service. No, the glass will not sharpen the waste disposal unit blades. To clean and hone the blades, grind a couple of ice in the disposal prior to running cold water through the system. You'll need to install a new unit if that does not work.</p>
<p>Very frequently the circular blade inside is stuck. DO NOT REACH INSIDE TO FREE IT! Just insert a long, sturdy, wood manage (a broom deal with will be adequate) into the opening. Let it rest versus the inside wall, and with force pushing down, turn clockwise up until you feel it turn freely. It may be necessary to reset the disposal. Locate the reset switch on the bottom of the system if so. If the clog continues, use any type of drain cleaner to release it.</p>
