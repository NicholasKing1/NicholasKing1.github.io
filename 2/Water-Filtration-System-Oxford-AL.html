<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the required instructions of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. If enabled to return to the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for efficiency, in addition to inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
