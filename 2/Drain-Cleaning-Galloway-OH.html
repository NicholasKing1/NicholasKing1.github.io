You may not find a similar match, however chances are you'll find one of the very same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>

<p>While numerous water heater problems can be efficiently fixed, some issues will necessitate total hot water heater replacement.

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the structure; extra, more considerable costs can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for residents. A PE or RA can help determine if installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss.</p>
