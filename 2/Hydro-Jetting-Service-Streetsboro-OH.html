<p>SofTap's water softening innovation is well-suited for household, commercial, and commercial applications, consisting of the prevention of limescale build-up in families and scaling in commercial water treatment systems, as well as enhancing existing reverse osmosis treatment systems. The innovation is simpler and more affordable than other softening systems on the market today that utilize zeolites, which should be regrowed using brine, or membrane nanofiltration that requires substantial water usage and high pressure.</p>
<p>The toilet takes a truly long time to flush. Here's how it works: During typical operation, the pressure in between the two check valves-- referred to as the zone of lowered pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure.
