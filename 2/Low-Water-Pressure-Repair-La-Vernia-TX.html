<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>

<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In La Vernia TX</h3>
<p>To minimize the need of gas line repair, it's important to understand the common causes of gas leaks. Indoor gas leakages from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning devices take place most commonly in the winter season. This is since houses are not adequately ventilated during the cooler months to prevent heat loss. If you have not done so currently, we recommend setting up carbon monoxide gas detectors beyond bed room doors to inform you of any possible gas leaks.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
