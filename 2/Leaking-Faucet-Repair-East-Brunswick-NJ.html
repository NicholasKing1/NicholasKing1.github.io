<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of major surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle often. When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with brand-new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing regular and significant leaks, you might be in need of water line repiping. If you do have regular leakages, we find that repiping can in fact be the cheaper and much better long-term option.</p>
<p>The level 3 of maintenance your disposal unit will need can differ depending on how often it's used, its age, and the type of items you're putting in it.
