<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Contractor in Wheeling</h2>

<p>Hidden water leaks are typically difficult and have Possibly Major Consequences. Changing your flapper might require slightly various steps than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To discover an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, but chances are you'll find one of the very same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>

At South West Plumbing, our certified plumbers have the resources to determine the source of the leak and get it fixed for you.
