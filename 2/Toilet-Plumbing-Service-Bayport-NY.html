<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Bayport NY</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically 2 layers of defense. The device enables water to press the check valves open when water is entering into the structure, however closes them shut when water tries to go the incorrect way. There are two different kinds of testable backflow prevention gadgets that are frequently defined-- a decreased pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device. There are a few others that I will mention however do not get hung up on them. I mention them just since they will be on a certification test.</p>
