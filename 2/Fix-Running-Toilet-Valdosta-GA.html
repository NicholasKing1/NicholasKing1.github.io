<p>Next comes the metal install ring and rubber cushion install (or cushion ring). Their right orientation will be labeled. When correctly fitted together hold the mount ring and disposal in place, these two pieces have complementary grooves that. Holding the install ring at the topmost part of the flange, work the cushion mount over the bottom of the flange, making sure that the rubber of the cushion mount is completely and firmly locking into the groove on the bottom of the flange. When set up correctly, you should not be able to get rid of the cushion mount without considerable stretching and pulling, and the mount ring should turn easily around it.</p>
