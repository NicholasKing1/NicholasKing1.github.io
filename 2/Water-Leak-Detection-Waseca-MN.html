<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
