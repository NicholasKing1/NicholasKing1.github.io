<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.

After they provided me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, given that I never ever wish to see this company again.</p>

The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline prior to the issue worsened. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a very expensive choice.</p>
