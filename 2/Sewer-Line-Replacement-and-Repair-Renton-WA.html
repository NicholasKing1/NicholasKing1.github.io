<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I have actually been to many carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener.

<p>For shallow pipes without any close-by utilities or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
<p>Whether you need garbage disposal repair or installation, Maeser can assist. A garbage disposal is an essential kitchen appliance in many houses today. While a lot of kitchen sink disposers can handle practically any type of food waste, they are not indestructible. When a fork, bone or other object jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Worn impellers on older disposals can end up being inadequate, increasing the danger of drain obstructions.</p>
