<p>Sewer lines can stop working for a range of reasons, including bad soil conditions, obstructions from grease and grime, and corrosion. Even trees and bushes can cause problems for sewer lines, specifically in older areas where clay pipe may have been used. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be doubly compounded if pipes have been enabled to freeze.</p>

Each and every installation ought to be looked at on a private basis as a distinct stand-alone system.

Fire defense system are designed to match the hazard that exists in the areas they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be extremely different, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be developed and installed to satisfy that particular hazard or need.
