After we have cleaned up the body, and the fixed components are still out of the body, and we have finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or debris. This can be challenging, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is essential that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system needs to be utilized to ensure the line is effectively flushed.</p>

There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, triggered the spread of illness or disease.</p>
