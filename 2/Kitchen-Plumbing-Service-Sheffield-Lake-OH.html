<p>When the only answer to your water heater woes is to replace the whole system, the best option is to upgrade to something that is energy effective.

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content.

More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
