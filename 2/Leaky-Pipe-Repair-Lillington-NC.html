<p>Insert the flange on the top side of the sink, and connect the fastening system on the underside (Image 1). It is practical to apply pressure on the flange from above using a 2nd set of hands or a heavy object. This will keep the flange in location while attaching the attaching system below. Ensure the plumber's putty is noticeably oozing beyond the edge of the flange all around (Image 2). Get rid of the excess putty with a rag once a total seal has formed.</p>
<p>Almost all makes can identify the age of a water heater from the model and identification number. Have a licensed plumber figure out whether it depends on existing code and safely working. Ask the plumber to record the size and evaluate of the hot water heater when they're out to carry out the inspection, and whether it fulfills the needs of the house.</p>
