<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in particular communities, based on our experience.</p>
